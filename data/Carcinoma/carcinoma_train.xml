<text>UNASSIGNED: Purpose Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) is characterized by high locoregional failure (LRF) rates after sphincter-preserving definitive chemoradiation (CRT) and is typically associated with anogenital human papilloma virus infection. Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC. Methods Sixty-one patients with stage I to III SCCAC received CRT including cisplatin, fluorouracil, and radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (45 to 54 Gy) plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab. The study was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in 3-year LRF rate (one-sided a, 0.10; power 90%), assuming a 35% LRF rate from historical data. Results Poor risk features included stage III disease in 64% and male sex in 20%. The 3-year LRF rate was 23% (95% CI, 13% to 36%; one-sided P = .03) by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point and 21% (95% CI, 7% to 26%) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in a post hoc analysis using methods consistent with historical data. Three-year rates were 68% (95% CI, 55% to 79%) for progression-free survival and 83% (95% CI, 71% to 91%) for overall survival. Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 32%, and 5% had treatment-associated deaths. Conclusion Although the addition of cetuximab to chemoradiation for SCCAC was associated with lower LRF rates than historical data with CRT alone, toxicity was substantial, and LRF still occurs in approximately 20%, indicating the continued need for more effective and less toxic therapies.</text>

<text>[Reconstructieve facial surgery in facial defects after the surgical removal of malignant skin tumours].</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>104</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Because of the enormous and continuing increase in cases of skin cancer in the Netherlands, dentists will increasingly see patients with skin cancer. The most common malignant skin cancers are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. With resection of a skin tumour, the oncological principles should be applied. For the closure of the resulting defect, a choice for the individual patient is made out of numerous techniques. Facial reconstructive surgery aims to restore the face in form and function and to maintain the patient's quality of life. By early recognition of skin tumours of the face, damage to the tissue can be limited. Dentists, who see their patients periodically, can play an important role here.</text>

<text>Developments in pharmacotherapy for treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>83</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: Most patients with non-small cell lung (NSCLC), including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma, have advanced disease at diagnosis and systemic therapy is the standard-of-care. About 20% of Caucasian patients are affected by an oncogene-addicted advanced NSCLC for which correspondent inhibitors are available. Areas covered: The main state-of-the-art synthetic anticancer drugs in the groups of chemotherapeutics, epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors for NSCLC treatment, are reviewed and discussed from phase III randomized practice-changing trials onwards. A structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature and of main meetings using a focused review question was undertaken Expert opinion: The survival of NSCLC patients is increasing, regardless of the presence or not of a specific target, due to the availability of new generation drugs. The continuous deep knowledge of the mechanisms of NSCLC development and the constant research into new drugs should lead to the discovery of new potential targets and the synthesis of corresponding inhibitors to improve the outcomes of each subgroup of patients in order to control the disease in a constantly growing percentage of patients.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: The clinicopathological and prognostic significance of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains controversial. To investigate this question, we conducted a meta-analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of electronic databases (up to July 10, 2016) was performed for relevant studies using multiple search strategies. Correlation between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological features/overall survival (OS) was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1,350 ESCC patients from eight studies were included. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) indicated that none of the clinicopathological characteristics was correlated with PD-L1 expression, including gender [OR =0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.59-1.18; P=0.31], histological differentiation (OR =1.33; 95% CI: 0.95-1.85; P=0.09), tumor depth (OR =0.66; 95% CI: 0.33-1.35; P=0.26), status of lymph node metastasis (OR =0.67; 95% CI: 0.30-1.52; P=0.34), distal metastasis (OR =0.66; 95% CI: 0.40-1.09; P=0.10) and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage (OR =0.93; 95% CI: 0.49-1.75; P=0.82). The combined hazard ratio (HR) for OS showed a trend that overexpression of PD-L1 might be associated with the survival outcome of ESCC, though the difference was not statistically significant (HR =1.65; 95% CI 0.95-2.85; P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the published studies, PD-L1 overexpression in ESCC was not associated with common clinicopathological characteristics. PD-L1 might be a poor prognostic biomarker for ESCC. Further large-scale research should be performed to reveal the precise clinicopathological and prognostic significance of PD-L1 in ESCC by unified testing standard.</text>

<text>Left thoracotomy for middle or lower thoracic esophageal carcinoma: still Sweet enough?</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>87</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy via left thoracotomy (the Sweet procedure) has long been the conventional route for resection of esophageal carcinoma, especially in China. However, this procedure is being increasingly critiqued, mainly regarding the lymphadenectomy. The objective of this study was to compare the Sweet procedure with the right upper mediastinal lymph node resection (MS) and Ivor-Lewis (IL) procedure in the treatment of middle or lower thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC-MLT) in terms of lymphadenectomy, postoperative complications, and long-term survival. METHODS: A total of 336 OSCC-MLT patients underwent radical intent surgery (188 with MS and 148 with IL procedure) between January 2007 and September 2013 in our hospital. After propensity score matching, 129 patients from each procedure were included. The efficacy of lymph node dissection at each station was estimated by the index of estimated benefit from lymph node dissection (IEBLD). RESULTS: IEBLD is relatively high in stations 2L, 2R, 8, 16 and 17. The metastasis rates and ratios were similar between the MS and IL procedures at each station. The MS procedure significantly outperformed the IL procedure with a shorter operating time (212 vs. 317 min), shorter in-hospital stay (10.7 vs. 15.3 days), and fewer postoperative complications (30.2% vs. 43.4%). However, the 5-year survival rates were not significantly different between the two procedures (46.9% vs. 44.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The MS procedure of esophagectomy is not inferior to the IL procedure in efficiency, moreover the MS procedure is safer.</text>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>138</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: To map detail distribution of metastatic supraclavicular (SCV) lymph nodes (LN) in esophageal cancer (EC) patients and determine the precise radiation therapy clinical target volume (CTV). METHODS: A total of 101 thoracic esophageal carcinoma patients after surgery experienced SCV LN metastasis were retrospectively examined. The SCV region is further divided into four subgroups. Using hand drawings registration, nodes were mapped to a template computed tomogram to provide a visual impression of nodal frequencies and anatomic distribution. RESULTS: In all, 158 nodes were considered to be clinical metastatic in the SCV region in the 101 patients, 74 on the left and 84 on the right. Seven of 158 (4.4%) positive LN were located in group I, 78 of 158 (49.37%) were located in group II, 72 of 158 nodes (45.6%) were located in group III, 1 of 158 (0.63%) located in group IV. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, the SCV group II and group III are considered to be the high risk regions of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) LN metastasis, which were defined as elective nodal irradiation (ENI) areas.</text>

<text>Prognostic and Predictive Factors in Patients with Advanced Penile Cancer Receiving Salvage (2nd or Later Line) Systemic Treatment: A Retrospective, Multi-Center Study.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>168</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Introduction and objectives: Metastatic penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is associated with dismal outcomes with median overall survival (OS) of 6-12 months in the first-line and &lt;6 months in the salvage setting. Given the rarity of this disease, randomized trials are difficult. Prognostic risk models may assist in rational drug development by comparing observed outcomes in nonrandomized phase II studies and retrospective data vs. predicted outcomes based on baseline prognostic factors in the context of historically used agents. In this retrospective study, we constructed a prognostic model in the salvage setting of PSCC patients receiving second or later line systemic treatment, and also explored differences in outcomes based on type of treatment. Materials and methods: We performed a chart review to identify patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic PSCC who received second or later line systemic treatment in centers from North America and Europe. The primary outcome was OS from initiation of treatment, with secondary outcomes being progression-free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR). OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify prognostic factors for outcomes using univariable and multivariable models. Results: Sixty-five patients were eligible. Seventeen of 63 evaluable patients had a response (27.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 16.6-39.7%) and median OS and PFS were 20 (95% CI = 20-21) and 12 (95% CI = 12, 16) weeks, respectively. Visceral metastasis (VM) and hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;=  10 gm/dl were consistently significant poor prognostic factors for both OS and PFS, and Hb was also prognostic for response. The 28 patients with neither risk factor had a median OS (95% CI) of 24 (20-40) weeks and 1-year (95% CI) OS of 13.7% (4.4-42.7%), while the 37 patients with 1 or 2 risk factors had median OS (95% CI) of 20 (16-20) weeks and 1-year (95% CI) OS of 6.7% (1.8-24.9%). Cetuximab-including regimens were associated with a trend for improved RR compared to other agents (Odds ratio = 5.05, 95% CI = 0.84-30.37, p = 0.077). Taxanes vs. non-taxane, and combination vs. single agent therapy was not associated with improved outcomes. The study is limited by its modest sample size. Conclusion: This is the first prognostic classification proposed for patients receiving salvage systemic therapy for advanced PSCC. The presence of VM and Hb &lt;=  10 gm/dl was associated with poor OS and PFS. Cetuximab appeared to be associated with better RR. This prognostic model may assist in salvage therapy drug development for this orphan disease by improving interpretation of outcomes seen in nonrandomized data.</text>

<offset>92</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: To delineate the frequency and clinicopathological features of urinary bladder cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at the King Fahd Hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia, and comprised medical records related to bladder tumours, from January 2006 to October 2015. Data was obtained from histopathologic reports and evaluated for age, gender, cystoscopic findings and histopathological characteristics at the time of presentation. RESULTS: Of the 116 cases, 96(82.7%) were of men while 20(17.3%) were of women. The mean age was 62.4  15.62 years (range: 20-115 years). Transitional cell carcinoma was the most common histological type, seen in 111(95.7%) cases, followed by adenocarcinoma 3(2.6%) and squamous cell carcinoma 2(1.7%). Of the transitional cell carcinoma cases, 78(70.5%) were superficial, while 33(29.5%) were muscle invasive. Most of the transitional cell carcinoma cases 72(65%) were of lower grade (grade I and II), while 39(35%) were of grade III. CONCLUSIONS: Our hospital-based pathology experience of urinary bladder cancer was comparable with earlier studies.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Objective To investigate the clinical effects and safety of bevacizumab combined with S-1 as the second-line treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic esophageal cancer after chemoradiation. Methods Patients with recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer after chemoradiation were treated with bevacizumab and S-1. Bevacizumab was used by intravenous infusion, 7.5mg/kg body weight on day 1; S-1 was used by oral at 80mg/m(2)  d on day 1-14, 21 days as a cycle of treatment and repeated until either pro- gressive disease or intolerable toxicity occurred. Chest CT were performed and RECIST 1.1 was used for response evaluation. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Side effects were recorded and analyzed. Results Totally 78 patients were enrolled in the study, including 67 squamous cell carcinoma and 11 adenocarcinoma histologically. The overall response (CR+PR) rate was 22.4% (17/76) and disease control (CR+PR+SD) rate was 61.8% (47/76) respectively. The median follow-up time was 20 months (range from 9 to 44 months). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.9 months (95% CI 4.4-5.5) and the median overall survival (OS) was 8.1 months (95% CI 7.6-9.2). The median PFS and OS of patients with metastasis diseases were 6.2 months (95% CI 3.3 to 6.3) and 8.5 months (95% CI 5.8 to 11.2), where PFS was longer than that of patients with local regional recurrence (median 5.0 months, 95% CI 3.0 to 5.5, P=0.017) and OS was longer than that of patients with regional disease and metastasis (median 8.0 months, 95% CI 4.6 to 9.5, P=0.010). The common adverse effects were mild to moderate neutropenia (84.2%), grade I-II hand and foot syndrome (51.3%), grade I-II nausea (48.7%), mild epistaxis (30.1%) and mild vomiting (14.5%). Esophageal bleeding occurred in 7.9% of patients. One patient (1.3%) died from massive bleeding which was caused by esophageal perforation. Conclusion Bevacizumab combined with S-1 was effective and safe for esophageal cancer patients who had recurrent or metastatic diseases after chemoradiation.</text>

<text>Prognostic significance of hyperfibrinogenemia in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>99</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Preoperative hyperfibrinogenemia is associated with inflammatory mediators and a poor prognosis in several types of cancer. However, there is no published information on the monitoring of patients with preoperative hyperfibrinogenemia after surgery. The aim of the study reported here was to assess the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of plasma fibrinogen levels in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma before and after surgical treatment. METHODS: Plasma fibrinogen levels were analyzed before surgical treatment (endoscopic submucosal dissection and surgery) in 82 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The clinicopathological significance of plasma fibrinogen levels and the relationship of plasma fibrinogen levels with several biomarkers were evaluated. The cutoff value for hyperfibrinogenemia was 321  mg/dl. Univariate and multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model were performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of plasma fibrinogen levels. The changing patterns of plasma fibrinogen were monitored after surgical treatment to evaluate prognostic impact. RESULTS: Hyperfibrinogenemia was significantly associated with advanced pathological stage of cancer and high C-reactive protein levels. Plasma fibrinogen levels significantly decreased after surgical treatment in recurrence-free patients but did not decrease in patients with recurrence. The multivariate analysis indicated that preoperative hyperfibrinogenemia was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival (hazard ratio 1.005, 95% confidence interval 1.000-1.010; P  =  0.039). CONCLUSION: Preoperative hyperfibrinogenemia was associated with inflammatory mediators, tumor progression, and poor survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The absence of a decrease in plasma fibrinogen levels after surgical treatment may indicate the possibility of tumor recurrence.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) are associated with response and resistance to targeted therapy. The EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OOSCC) was evaluated. A systematic literature review was undertaken to summarize current evidence and estimate the overall prevalence of EGFR TKD mutations in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples of 113 patients with OOSCC. Pyrosequencing was performed to investigate mutations in EGFR exons 18 to 21. Medline databases were searched for relevant studies. Studies reporting mutations in the EGFR TKD in HNSCC were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. RESULTS: No mutations in the EGFR TKD were observed in 113 samples of OOSCC. A total of 53 eligible studies were included in the systematic review. In total, from the review, 117 patients harboring a total of 159 EGFR TKD mutations were reported among 4122 patients with HNSCC. The overall prevalence of EGFR TKD mutations in HNSCC was 2.8%. CONCLUSION: Large-scale studies are warranted to provide further evidence regarding the mutation status of EGFR in patients with HNSCC.</text>

<text>Inhibiting ROS-NF-kB-dependent autophagy enhanced brazilin-induced apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>118</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Autophagy modulation has been considered a potential therapeutic strategy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A previous study confirmed that brazilin might possess significant anti-carcinogenic activity. However, whether brazilin induces autophagy and its roles in cell death in HNSCC are still unclear. In this study, we have shown that brazilin induced significant apoptosis in the Cal27 HNSCC cell line but not in oral keratinocyte cell line (OKC). In addition to showing apoptosis induction, we demonstrated the brazilin-induced autophagic response in the Cal27  cells, as evidenced by the formation of GFP-LC3 puncta, and also showed the upregulation of LC3-II and Beclin-1. Moreover, pharmacologically or genetically blocking autophagy enhanced the brazilin-induced apoptosis, indicating the cytoprotective role of autophagy in brazilin-treated Cal27  cells. Moreover, brazilin activated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB p65) nuclear translocation and increased NF-kB p65 reporter activity, which contributed to the upregulation of autophagy-related genes, including LC3-II and Beclin-1. Importantly, we found that brazilin triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in Cal27  cells. Furthermore, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, abrogated the effects of brazilin on the NF-kB p65-dependent autophagy. Taken together, our results demonstrated that brazilin increased the NF-kB p65-dependent autophagy through the promotion of ROS signalling pathways in HNSCC. These data also suggest that a strategy of blocking ROS-NF-kB p65-dependent autophagy to enhance the activity of brazilin warrants further attention for the treatment of HNSCC.</text>

<text>Association of post-treatment positron emission tomography with locoregional control and survival after radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>163</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the use of post-treatment F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for vulvar cancer and compare metabolic response to clinical outcomes. MATERIALS/METHODS: This retrospective study included 21 patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma treated with curative-intent radiation between 2007 and 2015. All patients received intensity-modulated radiation treatment (IMRT), a pre-treatment FDG/PET-CT, and a post-treatment FDG-PET/CT performed at a median time of 3months post-IMRT. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 28months. Post-treatment FDG-PET/CT demonstrated no evidence of disease (NED) in 12 patients and residual or progressive disease (PD) in 9. FDG-PET/CT response significantly correlated with biopsy-proven locoregional failure (p=0.02) and was the only significant factor associated with overall survival (OS) (p=0.049). Patients with NED on FDG-PET had a 2-year locoregional control (LRC) of 89% versus 25% for those with PD (p&lt;0.01). Patients with NED on FDG-PET/CT had a 2-year OS of 100% versus 42% for those with PD (p=0.02). FDG-PET/CT evaluation had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 71% for detecting pathologically proven residual disease in patients receiving neoadjuvant or definitive radiation. CONCLUSION: In this single-institution study of women with vulvar cancer, post-treatment response on FDG-PET/CT was associated with LRC and OS.</text>

<text>Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-targeted Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography and Immunohistochemical Findings in a Patient With Synchronous Metastatic Penile and Prostate Cancer.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: A 68-year-old man presented with synchronous metastatic penile and prostate cancer. 68Ga-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted ligand positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT) revealed tracer uptake in inguinal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal metastases. Lymph node biopsies and immunohistochemical staining revealed that both cancers involved the lymph nodes and expressed PSMA. In the deposits of penile squamous cell carcinoma, PSMA expression was seen in tumor vessels and may explain the PSMA-PET/CT positivity of inguinal nodes involved in squamous cell carcinoma. The interpretation of imaging in synchronous tumors should take this fact into consideration.</text>

<text>Phytochemicals for the Prevention of Photocarcinogenesis.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>57</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Ultraviolet (UV) exposure has an array of damaging effects and is the main cause of skin cancer in humans. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, is the most common type of cancer. Incidence of NMSC has increased due to greater UV radiation, increased life expectancy, and other changes in lifestyle; the annual cost of skin cancer treatment in the United States has increased concurrently to around eight billion dollars. Because of these trends, novel approaches to skin cancer prevention have become an important area of research to decrease skin cancer morbidity and defray the costs associated with treatment. Chemoprevention aims to prevent or delay the development of skin cancer through the use of phytochemicals. Use of phytochemicals as chemopreventive agents has gained attention due to their low toxicity and anti-carcinogenic properties. Phytochemicals also exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative effects which support their use as chemopreventive agents, particularly for skin cancer. Preclinical and human studies have shown that phytochemicals decrease UV-induced skin damage and photocarcinogenesis. In this review article, we discuss the selected phytochemicals that may prevent or delay UV-induced carcinogenesis and highlights their potential use for skin protection.

<text>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo three-dimensional (3D) relaxation time T 2(*) mapping of a dicarboxy-PROXYL radical using continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isotopically substituted dicarboxy-PROXYL radicals, 3,4-dicarboxy-2,2,5,5-tetra((2)H3)methylpyrrolidin-(3,4-(2)H2)-(1-(15)N)-1-oxyl ((2)H,(15)N-DCP) and 3,4-dicarboxy-2,2,5,5-tetra((2)H3)methylpyrrolidin-(3,4-(2)H2)-1-oxyl ((2)H-DCP), were used in the study. A clonogenic cell survival assay was performed with the (2)H-DCP radical using squamous cell carcinoma (SCC VII) cells. The time course of EPR signal intensities of intravenously injected (2)H,(15)N-DCP and (2)H-DCP radicals were determined in tumor-bearing hind legs of mice (C3H/HeJ, male, n  =  5). CW-EPR-based single-point imaging (SPI) was performed for 3D T 2(*) mapping. RESULTS: (2)H-DCP radical did not exhibit cytotoxicity at concentrations below 10  mM. The in vivo half-life of (2)H,(15)N-DCP in tumor tissues was 24.7      2.9  min (mean      standard deviation [SD], n  =  5). The in vivo time course of the EPR signal intensity of the (2)H,(15)N-DCP radical showed a plateau of 10.2      1.2  min (mean      SD) where the EPR signal intensity remained at more than 90% of the maximum intensity. During the plateau, in vivo 3D T 2(*) maps with (2)H,(15)N-DCP were obtained from tumor-bearing hind legs, with a total acquisition time of 7.5  min. CONCLUSION: EPR signals of (2)H,(15)N-DCP persisted long enough after bolus intravenous injection to conduct in vivo 3D T 2(*) mapping with CW-EPR-based SPI.</text>

<text>Single-cycle induction chemotherapy for resectable advanced hypopharyngeal cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>82</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The role of induction chemotherapy (IC) in the treatment of resectable advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has not been elucidated, and the most effective IC regimen for chemoselection is still unknown. At our institute we have not used the triple combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, fluorouracil (TPF) for chemoselection, but rather the double combination of docetaxel + cisplatin (TP). The aim of this study is to report the outcome of patients with advanced hypopharyngeal cancer treated by single cycle of IC with TP followed by chemoradiation (CRT) or surgery. METHODS: A total of 29 patients with resectable advanced hypopharyngeal cancer who were treated with a single cycle of IC were entered into the study. Responders were treated by CRT while nonresponders underwent surgery. Outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A single cycle of IC with TP achieved response in 21 of the 29 patients. The major side effect was neutropenia which could be managed without delaying the sequential treatment. The 2-year overall survival and disease-specific survival were both 74.0% (stage III 100%, stage IVA 69.1%). The cumulative 2-year laryngeal preservation rate was 100% for stage III and 53.6% for stage IVA. CONCLUSION: A single cycle of IC with the combination of docetaxel + cisplatin may be sufficient to select advanced hypopharyngeal cancer patients with radio-sensitivity. IC intended for organ preservation strategies should be low toxic. Our strategy may be a useful for providing the benefits of IC and the opportunity for curative surgery without delay.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) was recently described as a critical enzyme of tumor-initiating cells and, thus, a driver of tumorigenesis in lung non-small cell cancer (NSCC). It is important in metabolism under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is the unique subunit that determines HIF system activity, thereby regulating the adverse effects of hypoxia on cancer outcome. We examined the expression and prognostic significance of GLDC and HIF-1a in primary resected stage I/II NSCC. Immunohistochemistry for GLDC and HIF-1a was validated on two lung NSCC cell lines (A549, NCI-H460) and evaluated on a tissue microarray with 428 lung NSCC: 184 adenocarcinomas, 211 squamous cell carcinomas, and 33 large cell carcinomas (LCC). The results were correlated with clinico-pathological parameters. High levels of GLDC expression were detected in 33/428 cases (7.7%). HIF-1a was expressed in 71 (16.6%) cases and more frequently in squamous cell carcinoma (p  &lt;  0.001). Significantly longer survival was seen in younger patients (p  =  0.007), patients with non-LCC histology (p  =  0.006), lower primary tumor category (p  =  0.002), and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage (p  =  0.001). Both GLDC and HIF-1a were significantly associated with worse tumor-related survival (p  =  0.013, p  =  0.021, respectively), although not independent from each other in multivariate models. The combination of low-GLDC/negative HIF-1a expression was significantly prognostic for longer survival (p  =  0.002) and emerged as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (p  =  0.007, HR 2.052), next to UICC stage and age. We show that the combination of GLDC and HIF-1a expression is an independent prognostic factor in early-stage NSCC. Our results will assist future development of therapeutic approaches targeting GLDC or exploiting tumor hypoxia.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: We report the rare occurrence of a small bowel perforation secondary to a metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). A 70-year-old woman, who had previously undergone renal transplantation, presented with severe, sudden-onset abdominal pain. She was peritonitic on initial examination, with evidence of free intra-abdominal air on radiographic imaging. During an exploratory laparotomy, she was found to have a perforated jejunum secondary to disseminated metastases seen throughout her peritoneum. Following histopathological analysis, as well as further imaging studies, the primary malignancy was eventually identified as a cSCC on her upper back. Palliative care was started and the patient died 8   weeks following her initial presentation.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. CD147, a transmembrane glycoprotein, has been reported to be correlated with cancer progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance in various cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism of CD147 in regulating drug resistance in HNSCC cells. qRT-PCR were used to evaluated the expression of CD147 in 57 HNSCC tumorous tissues and 2 cell lines. Increased expression of CD147 was found in most HNSCC samples, and the expression level of CD147 was correlated with multidrug resistance. CD147 RNA silencing decreased the chemoresistance of HNSCC cells by deactivating MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Further investigation revealed that either rescue expression of CD147 or treatment of MAPK/ERK activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in CD147 knockdown CRC cell line attenuated the decreased chemoresistance in CD147 knockdown cells. Taken together, our results suggest that CD147 promotes chemoresistance by activating MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in HNSCC.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Verrucous carcinoma of the vulva is extremely rare. It is a slow growing, low malignant variant of a squamous cell carcinoma with a cauliflower appearance. Women with lichen planus have an increased risk of developing vulval cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old woman consulted for vulval itching. On clinical examination, a 3-cm large verrucous clitoral cancer in an area of lichen planus was seen. Based on her last clinical examination, the growth was estimated to be 1  cm(2) per month with an invasion depth after 6  months of 5  mm. A tumor developing in an area of lichen planus appears to have more aggressive features. This is the first time that the growth of a verrucous carcinoma has been documented in an area of lichen planus. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and patients should be aware of the aggressive behavior of cancers developing in areas of lichen planus and adjust their surgical management together with the follow-up strategy.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important cause of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), especially in young people. These tumours overexpress p16 and respond well to treatment. The rapid detection of HPV in patients with HNSCC may expedite treatment when p16 status is not immediately available. METHODS: Saliva-based DNA collection kits and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to determine the HPV status of 62 individuals with biopsy-proven HNSCC. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine tumour p16 status. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were included in the study. Twenty-nine samples (47%) were positive for HPV DNA, the majority of which were high risk (HR) subtypes (79%). Patients who tested positive for HR HPV were more likely to have a tumour arising in the oropharynx compared to a non-oropharyngeal site (74 vs 26%; p   =   0.003). A positive HR HPV saliva assay was 100% specific (95% CI 59-100%) and had a 100% positive predictive value (95% CI 75-100%) for a p16 positive tumour arising in the oropharynx. In contrast, a negative HR HPV assay had a 96% negative predictive value (95% CI 80-100%) for tumours arising in a non-oropharyngeal site. Independent of site, the saliva assay had a sensitivity of 77% (95% CI 54-91%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI 77-99%), respectively, for a p16 positive tumour. CONCLUSION: We show that a saliva based assay is an effective method for detecting HPV in patients with HNSCC and that a positive HR HPV test is highly specific for p16 positive tumours arising in the oropharynx. This simple and rapid test could be used in cases where a biopsy of the primary tumour is not readily available.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Many cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are characterized by a metabolic rewiring with increased glucose uptake and lactate production, termed as aerobic glycolysis. Targeting aerobic glycolysis presents a promising strategy for cancer therapy. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of glycolysis blockage by targeting phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) in HNSCC. METHODS: 1-(4-pyridinyl)-3-(2-quinolinyl)-2-propen-1-one (PFK15) was used as a selective antagonist of PFKFB3. Glycolytic flux was determined by measuring glucose uptake, lactate production and ATP yield. PFKFB3 expression was examined using HNSCC tissue arrays. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and motility were analysed. HNSCC xenograft mouse model and metastasis mouse model were established to examine the therapeutic efficacy of PFK15 in vivo. RESULTS: HNSCC showed an increased PFKFB3 expression compared with adjacent mucosal tissues (P   &lt;   0.01). Targeting PFKFB3 via PFK15 significantly reduced the glucose uptake, lactate production and ATP generation in HNSCC cell lines. PFK15 suppressed cell proliferation, halted cell cycle progression and induced cell apoptosis. The invadopodia of HNSCC cells was markedly reduced after PFK15 treatment, thereby impairing cell motility and extracellular matrix degradation ability. The in vivo data from the xenograft mice models proved that PFK15 administration suppressed the tumor growth. And the results from the metastatic mice models showed administration of PFK15 alleviated the lung metastasis of HNSCC and extended the life expectancy of mice. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB3 via PFK15 suppressed tumor growth and alleviated metastasis in HNSCC, offering a promising strategy for cancer therapy.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a unique and major health concern worldwide. Significant increases in glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis have been observed in HNSCC cells. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) represent a major hub in the glycolysis pathway, with GLUT4 having the highest glucose affinity. However, GLUT4's role in HNSCC has not been fully appreciated. METHODS: An in silico analysis was performed in HNSCC cohorts to identify the most significant glucose transporter associated with HNSCC patient prognosis. An immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray with samples from 90 HNSCC patients was used to determine the association of GLUT4 with prognosis. Complementary functional expression and knockdown studies of GLUT4 were performed to investigate whether GLUT4 plays a role in HNSCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The detailed molecular mechanism of the function of GLUT4 in inducing HNSCC cell metastasis was determined. RESULTS: Our clinicopathologic analysis showed that increased GLUT4 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients was significantly associated with a poor overall survival (OS, P   =   0.035) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P   =   0.001). Furthermore, the ectopic overexpression of GLUT4 in cell lines with low endogenous GLUT4 expression resulted in a significant increase in migratory ability both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the reverse phenotype was observed in GLUT4-silenced cells. Utilizing a GLUT4 overexpression model, we performed gene expression microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to determine that the transcription factor tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) was the main downstream regulator of GLUT4. In addition, DDX58 was confirmed to be the downstream target of TRIM24, whose downregulation is essential for the migratory phenotype induced by GLUT4-TRIM24 activation in HNSCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identified altered glucose metabolism in the progression of HNSCC and showed that it could be partially attributed to the novel link between GLUT4 and TRIM24. This novel signaling axis may be used for the prognosis and therapeutic treatment of HNSCC in the future.</text>

<text>INTRODUCTION: Advanced stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck carries an overall poor prognosis, and survivorship gains have remained relatively stagnant compared to other malignancies due to its complex tumor biology and lack of proven effective targeting agents. METHODS: We present a case of an exceptional responder to molecular-targeted therapy for metastatic oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma using a chemotherapeutic agent FDA approved for breast cancer and targeting the HER2/Neu receptor in order to discuss the larger clinical implications. RESULTS: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has recently instituted the Exceptional Responders Initiative in order to identify such patients with unexpected outcomes in order to expedite the development of additional targeted therapies. This case illustrates the opportunity for cure using targeted oncogene identification in a scenario of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma with lung metastasis typically considered fatal. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular tumor analysis is an infrequently utilized tool in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; however, as understanding of biologic mechanisms improves, additional molecular targets will become available and expand treatment opportunities such as HER2/Neu targeting. The Exceptional Responders Initiative is a unique strategy with potential to expedite progress.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Palliative radiotherapy (PRT) improves patient quality of life (QoL) through alleviating cancer-associated symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and ulceration. Palliative management of patients with skin malignancies requires consideration of cosmetic and psychosocial outcomes as QoL measures. In this review, we highlight the current literature and advances in the use of PRT for patients with the three most commonly encountered forms of skin malignancies: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma. The disease course and sensitivity to radiation varies, thus dictating the palliative goal and scheduling for PRT.</text>

<text>Prognostic roles of mRNA expression of notch receptors in non-small cell lung cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>85</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Notch signalling is aberrantly activated in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, the prognostic roles of mRNA expression of four Notch receptors in NSCLC patients remain elusive. In this report, we reported the prognostic roles of Notch receptors in a total of 1,926 NSCLC patients through "The Kaplan-Meier plotter" (KM plotter) database which is capable to assess the effect of 22,277 genes on survival of NSCLC patients. We found that mRNA high expression level of Notch1 was associated with better overall survival (OS) for all NSCLC patients, hazard ratio (HR) 0.78 (0.69-0.89), p=0.00019, better OS in adenocarcinoma (Ade) patients, HR 0.59 (0.46-0.75), p=1.5e-05, as well as in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients, HR 0.78 (0.62-0.99), p=0.044. mRNA high expression levels of Notch2 and Notch3 were associated with worsen OS for all NSCLC patients, as well as in Ade, but not in SCC patients. mRNA high expression level of Notch4 was not found to be associated with to OS for all NSCLC patients. In addition, mRNA high expression levels of Notch2, Notch3, but Notch4 are significantly associated with the NSCLC patients who have different smoking status. Our results indicate that mRNA expression of Notch receptors may have distinct prognostic values in NSCLC patients. These results will benefit for developing tools to accurately predict the prognosis of NSCLC patients.</text>

<text>Effect of Formalin Fixation on Surgical Margins in Patients With Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>94</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: Formalin fixation causes shrinkage of surgical margins, which can result in the underestimation of tumor-free margins. The purpose of this study was to show the effect of formalin fixation on surgical margins. Another aim of this study was to evaluate surgical margin shrinkage after fixation of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) specimens of the gingivobuccal sulcus (GBS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. The study sample consisted of OSCC specimens of the GBS after composite resection. The primary predictor variable was the length of the linear margin at various locations (anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral). The primary outcome variable was the percentage of change in each respective margin (anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral) after fixation in 10% formalin for 24  hours. Other variables were age, gender, use of smokeless tobacco, smoking status, and tumor staging. The difference between pre-fixation and post-fixation data was calculated using paired t test. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 15 patients (7 men and 8 women; age range, 55 to 65  yr) diagnosed with OSCC of the GBS. Shrinkage of surgical margins (decrease) occurred after fixation compared with margins before fixation. The average surgical margin shrinkages were 18.7% anteriorly, 14.9% posteriorly, 23.6% medially, and 23.9% laterally. This shrinkage was statistically significant (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: Formalin fixation causes considerable shrinkage of surgical margins. This phenomenon should be considered by the pathologist before providing the final histopathology report.</text>

<text>Prognostic Factors of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Young Patients: A Systematic Review.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>90</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: The objective of this review was to identify clinical and pathologic factors related to the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma in young patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a literature search of articles indexed in PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Science Direct. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish were included. An age threshold of 45  years was established for the purpose of selection. RESULTS: A total of 14,746 articles were retrieved, and 11 relevant studies were selected. The total sample comprised 2,317 patients, and there was a predominance of male patients. The tongue was the most commonly affected anatomic site. The prevalence of tobacco use ranged from 9.0 to 85.7%, and alcohol consumption was observed in 26.1 to 78.6% of the cases studied. Tobacco use and alcohol consumption were the main risk factors in young patients. Regarding tumor-node-metastasis stage, most studies found a predominance of cases diagnosed in early stages (I and II). The studies varied widely in terms of histologic grade of malignancy and locoregional recurrences. Regional lymph node metastases had a negative impact on overall and specific survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a lack of solid evidence of differences in the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma between young and older patients. This may reflect variations in the samples studied, including the prevalence of risk factors, access to health care services, and time since diagnosis.</text>

<text>Small round blue cell tumors of the sinonasal tract: a differential diagnosis approach.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>87</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: One of the most challenging diagnostic categories within tumors of the sinonasal tract is the small round blue cell tumors. Biopsies are usually small and limited, resulting in considerable diagnostic difficulty for practicing surgical pathologists. These tumors share several overlapping histologic and immunophenotypic findings while also showing considerable variation within and between cases. Specific tumor site of origin, imaging findings, and clinical findings must be combined with the histology and pertinent ancillary studies if the correct diagnosis is to be reached. Discrimination between neoplasms is critical as there are significant differences in therapy and overall outcome. It is important to have a well developed differential diagnosis for this category of tumors, where each of the diagnoses is considered, evaluated, and either confirmed or excluded from further consideration. In an undifferentiated tumor, showing a small round blue cell morphology, using the mnemonic 'MR SLEEP' helps to highlight tumors to consider: melanoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (including NUT carcinoma), small cell osteosarcoma, lymphoma, esthesioneuroblastoma (olfactory neuroblastoma), Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor, pituitary adenoma, and plasmacytoma. A panel of pertinent immunohistochemistry studies, histochemistries and/or molecular tests should aid in reaching a diagnosis, especially when taking the pattern and intensity of reactions into consideration.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: As the human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma epidemic has developed in the past several decades, it has become clear that these tumors have a wide variety of morphologic tumor types and features. For the practicing pathologist, it is critical to have a working knowledge about these in order to make the correct diagnosis, not to confuse them with other lesions, and to counsel clinicians and patients on their significance (or lack of significance) for treatment and outcomes. In particular, there are a number of pitfalls and peculiarities regarding HPV-related tumors and their nodal metastases that can easily result in misclassification and confusion. This article will discuss the various morphologic types and features of HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinomas, specific differential diagnoses when challenging, and, if established, the clinical significance of each finding.</text>

<text>Virus-associated neoplasms of the nasopharynx and sinonasal tract: diagnostic problems.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>87</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: A significant fraction of nasopharyngeal and sinonasal tumors are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or human papillomavirus (HPV). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma harbor EBV in practically all cases, although a small proportion of cases of the former harbor HPV. Sinonasal inverted papillomas harbor HPV in about 25% of cases. Sinonasal squamous cell carcinomas harbor transcriptionally active HPV in about 20% of cases, and limited data suggest that this subset has a better prognosis than the HPV-negative subset. This review addresses the diagnostic issues of the EBV-associated tumors. Difficulties in diagnosis of NPC may be encountered when there are prominent crush artifacts, many admixed lymphoid cells masking the neoplastic cells, or numerous interspersed granulomas, whereas benign cellular components (epithelial crypts and germinal centers) and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia can potentially be mistaken for NPC. Immunostaining for pan-cytokeratin and/or in situ hybridization for EBER can help in confirming or refuting a diagnosis of NPC. The main diagnostic problem of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is recognition of the neoplastic nature of those examples predominated by small cells or showing a mixture of cells. The identification of a destructive infiltrate (dense expansile infiltrate; angiocentric growth) and definite cytologic atypia (clear cells; many medium-sized cells) would favor a diagnosis of lymphoma, which can be supported by immunohistochemistry (most commonly CD3+, CD5-, CD56+) and in situ hybridization for EBER. In conclusion, among nasopharyngeal and sinonasal neoplasms, demonstration of EBV may aid in diagnosis, particularly NPC and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Demonstration of HPV does not have a role yet in diagnosis, although this may change in the future.</text>

<text>Squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract: dysplasia and select variants.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>88</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) mucosal premalignant lesions include non-keratinizing and keratinizing intraepithelial dysplasia. The keratinizing type of intraepithelial dysplasia represents the majority of UADT dysplasias. Historically, grading of UADT dysplasias has followed a three tier system to include mild, moderate and severe dysplasia. Recent recommendations have introduced a two tier grading scheme to including low-grade (ie, mild dysplasia) and high-grade (moderate and severe dysplasia/carcinoma in situ) providing for better consensus among pathologists in the interpretation of such dysplastic lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant neoplasm of the UADT. Several variants of squamous cell carcinoma are recognized among which the more common types include papillary squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous carcinoma, spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma (sarcomatoid carcinoma) and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. Each of these variants of squamous cell carcinoma poses diagnostic challenges and each correlates to specific therapy and prognosis. This review details the proposed update in the grading of UADT dysplasia to a two-tiered system as well as providing the key diagnostic features for select variants of squamous cell carcinoma.</text>

<text>Squamous Cell Carcinoma In Situ Upstaged to Invasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A 5-Year, Single Institution Retrospective Review.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>128</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Shave biopsy may not be able to accurately distinguish squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) from invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Information on the incidence of biopsy-proven SCCIS upstaged to SCC after a more complete histologic examination is limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and clinical risk factors associated with upstaging the biopsy diagnosis of SCCIS into invasive SCC based on findings during Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). METHODS: All MMS cases of SCCIS performed between March 2007 and February 2012 were identified, MMS operative notes were examined, and invasive dermal components were confirmed by the MMS slide review. Upstaged SCCIS was defined as biopsy-diagnosed SCCIS subsequently found to be an invasive SCC during MMS. RESULTS: From 566 cases with the preoperative diagnosis of SCCIS, 92 (16.3%) cases were SCCIS upstaged to SCC. Location of ears, nose, lips, and eyelids, preoperative diameter &gt;10 mm, and biopsy report mentioning a transected base were significant predictors of upstaged SCCIS. CONCLUSION: Considering the possibility that over 16% of SCCIS may be truly invasive SCC, biopsy-proven SCCIS should be treated adequately with margin-assessed treatment modalities such as surgical excision or Mohs surgery when indicated.</text>

<text>Single cell time-lapse analysis reveals that podoplanin enhances cell survival and colony formation capacity of squamous cell carcinoma cells.</text>
</passage>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>142</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Tumor initiating cells (TICs) are characterized by high clonal expansion capacity. We previously reported that podoplanin is a TIC-specific marker for the human squamous cell carcinoma cell line A431. The aim of this study is to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the high clonal expansion potential of podoplanin-positive A431cells using Fucci imaging. Single podoplanin-positive cells created large colonies at a significantly higher frequency than single podoplanin-negative cells, whereas no difference was observed between the two types of cells with respect to cell cycle status. Conversely, the cell death ratio of progenies derived from podoplanin-positive single cell was significantly lower than that of cells derived from podoplanin-negative cells. Single A431 cells, whose podoplanin expression was suppressed by RNA interference, exhibited increased cell death ratios and decreased frequency of large colony forming. Moreover, the frequency of large colony forming decreased significantly when podoplanin-positive single cells was treated with a ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase) inhibitor, whereas no difference was observed in single podoplanin-negative cells. Our current study cleared that high clonal expansion capacity of podoplanin-positive TICs populations was the result of reduced cell death by podoplanin-mediated signaling. Therefore, podoplanin activity may be a therapeutic target in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Predicting response to checkpoint blockade therapy for lung cancer has largely focused on measuring programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells. PD-L1 expression is geographically heterogeneous within many tumors, however, and we questioned whether small tissue samples, such as biopsies, might be sufficiently representative of PD-L1 expression for evaluating this marker in lung cancer tumors. To evaluate the extent of variability of PD-L1 expression in small tissue samples, and how that variability affects accuracy of overall assessment of PD-L1 in lung cancer, we scored immunohistochemical staining for PD-L1 in tissue microarray cores from a series of 79 squamous cell lung cancers and 71 pulmonary adenocarcinomas. Our study found substantial inconsistencies for the percentages of cells staining positive for PD-L1 among different tissue microarray cores in many cases of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. This variable scoring was seen at both high levels and low levels of PD-L1 expression, and by further evaluation of cases with discordant results on full-face sections to assess geographic distribution of staining, we found that discordant results among different tissue microarray cores reflected geographic variation of PD-L1 expression in those tumors. Moreover, we found that as a result of heterogeneous expression, the sensitivity of a single small tissue sample can be as low as 85% for detecting PD-L1 expression at scoring thresholds commonly used in clinical practice. Based on these studies, we conclude that many cases of lung cancer could be inaccurately or variably scored for PD-L1 expression with a single biopsy sample. Accordingly, lung cancer patients can be inconsistently classified for PD-L1 expression status, particularly when a threshold for the percentage of positive cells is used to determine eligibility for checkpoint blockade therapy.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.213.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a deadly disease where systemic therapy has relied upon empiric chemotherapy despite the presence of genomic alterations pointing to candidate therapeutic targets, including recurrent amplification of the gene encoding receptor tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we demonstrate that EGFR-targeting small-molecule inhibitors have efficacy in EGFR-amplified oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but may become quickly ineffective. Resistance can occur following the emergence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and by reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway following EGFR blockade. We demonstrate that blockade of this rebound activation with MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) inhibition enhances EGFR inhibitor-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and delays resistance to EGFR monotherapy. Furthermore, genomic profiling shows that cell cycle regulators are altered in the majority of EGFR-amplified tumours and a combination of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) and EGFR inhibitors prevents the emergence of resistance in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that upfront combination strategies targeting EGFR amplification, guided by adaptive pathway reactivation or by co-occurring genomic alterations, should be tested clinically.</text>

<text>More than skin deep? Potential nicotinamide treatment applications in chronic kidney transplant recipients.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>107</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Non-melanoma cutaneous carcinomas, or skin cancers, predominantly squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), are the most common malignancies occurring in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Squamous cell carcinoma risk is dramatically elevated in KTRs, occurring at rates of up 45-250 times those reported in general populations. New non-melanoma skin cancers in KTRs with a prior non-melanoma skin cancer also develop at 3-times the rate reported in non-KTRs with the same clinical history. The unique aggressiveness of SCCs in KTRs increases patient morbidity, due to the high rate of new lesions requiring treatment, frequently surgical excision. Oral nicotinamide shows promise in the chemoprevention of the especially aggressive non-melanoma skin cancers which occur in KTRs. This benefit might be conferred via its inhibition of sirtuin enzymatic pathways. Nicotinamide's concurrent hypophosphatemic effect may also partially ameliorate the disturbed calcium-phosphorus homeostasis in these patients-a putative risk factor for mortality, and graft failure. Conceivably, a phase 3 trial of nicotinamide for the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers in KTRs, lasting at least 12-mo, could also incorporate imaging and laboratory measures which assess nicotinamide's impact on subclinical cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease risk, and progression.</text>

<text>Failed Mask Ventilation due to Air Leakage around the Orbit in a Patient with a History of Radical Maxillofacial Surgery with Orbital Exenteration.</text>

<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>147</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: A 72-year-old male (height: 160 cm, weight: 53 kg) was scheduled to undergo left renal and male with ans uterine tract resection. The patient had previously undergone right radical maxillofacial surgery with orbital exenteration 14 years before the present operation to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the right maxillary sinus, with tumour invasion to the orbital floor. An anaesthesiologist encountered difficulty in performing mask ventilation during the induction of anaesthesia in the patient, despite a good mask fit on the face, because the adhesive tape around the orbit had moved. Urgent endotracheal intubation was successful without desaturation. A postoperative examination revealed that a communication between the nasal cavity and the orbit was visible on computed tomograms obtained nine years before the surgery. The patient felt the air leakage around the adhesive tape. The anaesthesiologist should have removed the adhesive tape to directly observe the lesion and should have realised that the communication might cause difficulty in mask ventilation. Careful examination of the airways using computed tomography and precise interviews may improve the understanding of patients' airways and may help avoid similar events.</text>

</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>47</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Basosquamous carcinoma (BsC) is a controversial entity and both a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. BsC has mixed histopathological characteristics of both basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). BCC and SCC display characteristic histopathology and behaviour; on the other hand, BsC is a rare tumour, which has variable morphology and displays less predictable behaviour. An early diagnosis of BsC is important due to the particularly aggressive nature of the tumour, the increased likelihood of recurrence and the potential for metastasis. Here, we present a case of BsC presenting as an extensive ulcer on the back. The case highlights the aggressive nature of the tumour and variation in appearance. It is important for all clinicians to be aware of this diagnosis so that the urgency of adequate biopsy in specialist clinics is not underestimated.</text>

<text>The Patterns of Practice and Outcomes of Penile Cancer in Ontario.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>66</offset>
<text>AIMS: Penile cancer is a rare malignancy in Western countries. The management guidelines are mainly derived from retrospective studies as there are no randomised trials. The primary objective of this study was to assess patterns of practice and outcomes of penile squamous cell carcinoma in Ontario. Secondary objectives included examining trends in incidence, pathological characteristics and prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients diagnosed with penile cancer between 2000 and 2010 were identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry and all available pathology reports related to penile cancer during this period were reviewed. RESULTS: Pathology reports of 419 new cases of penile squamous cell carcinoma were reviewed. There was a significant improvement in completeness of the pathology reports in recent years. The age-adjusted incidence was 0.9 per 100 000 person-years. Most patients presented with a pT1 lesion (63%). A partial penectomy (40%) was the most common surgical procedure. Over 38% of patients identified to be eligible for organ-sparing surgery had a total or partial penectomy. Only 23% of the eligible patients identified to require lymph node dissection underwent the procedure. The 5 year disease-specific survival for stage 0, I, II, III were 94%, 93%, 74% and 52%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant variation in the patterns of practice in Ontario. A large proportion of patients in this cohort were probably overtreated for the primary malignancy and undertreated for the regional nodes.</text>

<text>Neuroendrocrine tumors of the uterine cervix: A therapeutic challenge for gynecologic oncologists.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>98</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are aggressive diseases developing from neuroendocrine cells that most frequently involve the gastro-entero-pancreatic tract and the lung, but more rarely are found in almost all body tissues. Limited biological and clinical data are currently available for NETs in uncommon sites, such as female genital tract. NETs represent 0.9% to 1.5% of the tumors of the uterine cervix. They are more likely to have lymph-vascular space invasion and lymph node involvement, and to develop local and distant relapses when compared with the mostly common cervical squamous cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas. Positive immunostaining for synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56, and neuron-specific enolase is often detected in cervical NETs . The most recent editions of the World Health Organization Classification of Gynecologic Tract tumors grouped cervical carcinoid tumor and atypical carcinoid tumor into low-grade NETs and cervical small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma into high-grade NETs. High-risk HPV DNA is detected in almost all cervical high-grade NETs. No treatment guidelines, based on prospective, well-designed clinical trials, are currently available due to the rarity of these tumors. Many authors have reported different multimodality approaches, mainly derived from NETs of the lung. These usually consist in radical hysterectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation for early stage disease, definitive concurrent chemoradiation sometimes preceded by neoadjuvant chemotherapy and followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced disease, and palliative chemotherapy for metastatic disease. In this systematic review, we address the histologic classification of cervical NETs, analyze their pathogenesis and overall prognosis, and evaluate the different treatment modalities described in the literature, in order to offer a possible algorithm that may help the clinicians in diagnosing and treating patients with these uncommon and aggressive malignancies.</text>

</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>85</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Objective: To evaluate the effects of tea and coffee intakes on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) stratified by milk intake. Methods: A case-control study involving 593 OSCC patients confirmed by pathological diagnoses and 1 128 gender-age frequency matched controls was conducted in Fujian province during September 2010-March 2016. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the effects of coffee, tea intakes and related variables on OSCC. Additive interaction was estimated by relative excess risk interaction (RERI), attributable proportions interaction (API) and synergy index (SI). Results: Tea intake was significantly associated with decreased risk of OSCC: the adjusted ORs were 0.54 for all subjects (95%CI: 0.41-0.71), 0.47 for milk consumers (95%CI: 0.31-0.71) and 0.57 for non-milk consumers (95%CI: 0.40-0.81). Moreover, starting tea drinking at age &gt;= 25 years, moderate tea concentration and water temperature, drinking green tea and oolong tea showed effects to decrease the risk for OSCC in three groups. Additionally, there was a tendency of a reduced risk with increased daily tea drinking and longer tea-drinking period (all trend P&lt;0.05). No significant association was observed between coffee intake and OSCC. A multiplicative but not additive interactions was found between tea drinking and milk intake. Additionally, we did not observe multiplicative and additive interaction between coffee drinking and milk intake. Conclusion: Tea drinking is a protective factor for OSCC, and there is a multiplicative interaction between tea drinking and milk intake. Therefore, tea drinking and increasing intake of milk can reduce the risk of OSCC at certain extent.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Bell  s palsy is the most common cause of facial paralysis worldwide and the most common disorder of the cranial nerves. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, accounting for 60-75% of all acquired peripheral facial nerve palsies. Our case shows the first case of a microcystic adnexal carcinoma-like squamous cell carcinoma as a cause of facial nerve palsy. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a 70-year-old Caucasian male, experienced subsequent functional impairment of the trigeminal and the glossopharyngeal nerve about 1     years after refractory facial nerve palsy. An extensive clinical work-up and tissue biopsy of the surrounding parotid gland tissue was not able to determine the cause of the paralysis. Primary infiltration of the facial nerve with subsequent spreading to the trigeminal and glossopharyngeal nerve via neuroanastomoses was suspected. After discussing options with the patient, the main stem of the facial nerve was resected to ascertain the diagnosis of MAC-like squamous cell carcinoma, and radiochemotherapy was subsequently started. CONCLUSION: This case report shows that even rare neoplastic etiologies should be considered as a cause of refractory facial nerve palsy and that it is necessary to perform an extended diagnostic work-up to ascertain the diagnosis. This includes high-resolution MRI imaging and, as perilesional parotid biopsies might be inadequate for rare cases like ours, consideration of a direct nerve biopsy to establish the right diagnosis.</text>

<text>Granular cell tumor mimicking a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue: a case report.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>85</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Granular cell tumor is a rare benign tumor that can present a pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the covering epithelium. This lesion is not encapsulated and can be characterized by a pseudo invasive growth pattern, represented by the tumoral cells that infiltrate between adjacent connective tissue elements. Diagnostic difficulties may arise because histopathological features of the pronounced pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia can be confused with a well-differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of this case report is to demonstrate the role of an immunohistochemical panel in the diagnosis of a granular cell tumor in the tongue with clinical and microscopic features resembling an oral squamous cell carcinoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old white man with a history of heavy smoking and alcohol abuse presented an ulcerated nodular lesion in the dorsum of the tongue. The lesion was asymptomatic with fast growth. The clinical diagnosis was an oral squamous cell carcinoma. An incisional biopsy was performed and the ensuing histopathological analysis showed a pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia in the overlying epithelium mimicking the invasion of epithelial tumor cells into the connective tissue as in an oral squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical antibodies (S-100, vimentin, CD68, p53, Ki-67, E-cadherin, collagen IV and cytokeratin AE1/AE3) were used to characterize molecular aspects of the lesion. Strong staining of S-100 protein, CD68, vimentin, E-cadherin and low proliferative activity observed with Ki-67 expression confirmed the diagnosis of a granular cell tumor. The patient was submitted to surgical excision of the whole lesion. At a 12-month check-up, there was no evidence of recurrence. CONCLUSION: This case report showed that the immunohistochemical profile was helpful in determining the clinical behavior of the tumor and establishing the final diagnosis with appropriate treatment.</text>

<text>FDG PET using SUVmax for preoperative T-staging of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with and without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>133</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Accurate T-staging is pivotal for predicting prognosis and selecting appropriate therapies for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The diagnostic performance of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for its T-staging is uncertain. We investigated use of FDG PET/CT for preoperative T-staging of patients with ESCC. METHODS: Patients with ESCC given preoperative FDG PET/CT scans, either with (CRT([+]) group) or without (CRT([-]) group) neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, were retrospectively reviewed. Maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the primary tumors on FDG PET/CT scans were measured, and histopathological results were used as the reference standard. The associations between pathological T-stage and potential factors of age, tumor location, tumor grade, tumor size, and tumor SUVmax were analyzed. The cut-off levels of SUVmax for predicting different T-stages and for residual viable tumors after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were determined using receiver operating characteristic analyses. RESULTS: We enrolled 103 patients (45 in the CRT([-]) group; 58 in the CRT([+]) group). SUVmax, an independent predictive factor, positively correlated with the pathological T-stage in both groups (CRT([-]) group:      =   0.736, p   &lt;   0.001; and CRT([+]) group:      =   0.792, p   &lt;   0.001). The overall accuracy of the PET/CT with thresholded SUVmax for predicting the pathological T-stage was 73.3% in the CRT([-]) group (SUVmax of T0: 0-1.9, T1: 2.0-4.4, T2: 4.5-6.5, T3: 6.6-13.0, T4: &gt;13.0) and 67.2% in the CRT([+]) group (SUVmax of T0: 0-3.4, T1: 3.5-3.9, T2: 4.0-5.5, T3: 5.6-6.2, T4: &gt; 6.2). For CRT([-]) group, the accuracy using an SUVmax cut-off of 4.4 to differentiate early (T0-1) from locally advanced disease (T2-4) was 82.2% (95% CI, 71.1-93.4%). For CRT([+]) group, the accuracy using an SUVmax cut-off of 3.4 to predict residual viable tumors (non-T0) after completion of chemoradiotherapy was 82.8% (95% CI, 73.0-92.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The FDG avidity of a primary esophageal tumor significantly positively correlated with the pathological T-stage. PET/CT with thresholded SUVmax was useful for predicting T-stage and differentiating residual viable tumors.</text>

<text>Association between the diagnosis-to-treatment interval and overall survival in Taiwanese patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>140</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between the diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) and overall survival (OS) in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). METHODS: A total of 18,677 patients with first primary OSCC identified in the Taiwanese Cancer Registry Database between 2004 and 2010 were examined. The effect of DTI on 5-year OS rates was investigated with multivariate Cox regression analysis. After the identification of the optimal cutoff for DTI based on the 5-year OS rates, DTI was classified in the following 20-day groups: &lt;= 20 days (57% of the study patients), 21-45 days (34%), 46-90 days (6%)  and &gt;= 91 days (3%). In additional exploratory analyses, DTI was reclassified in the following 30-day interval groups: &lt;= 30 days (81% of the study patients), 31-60 days (14%), 61-90 days (2%)  and &gt;= 91 days (3%). RESULTS: Multivariate analyses identified DTI (&lt;= 20 days versus  other subgroups), sex (female versus  male), age (&lt;65 versus  &gt;= 65 years), clinical stage (p-stage I versus  p-stage II, III, IV)  and treatment modality (initial surgery versus  initial non-surgery) as independent prognostic factors for 5-year OS. Compared with a DTI &lt;= 20 days, the DTI categories &gt;= 91 days (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.28, P  &lt;  0.001), 46-90 days (HR: 1.25, P  &lt;  0.001) and 21-45 days (HR: 1.07, P  =  0.007) were independently associated with a higher risk of 5-year mortality. Similar results were obtained for DTI &lt;= 30 days groups. CONCLUSIONS: DTI is independently associated with 5-year OS in OSCC patients. A DTI longer than 30 days or even 20 days may potentially decrease survival.</text>

<text>Importance: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has shown resistance to conventional concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) therapy and carries a relatively poor prognosis in comparison with HPV-positive disease, with decreased locoregional control and overall survival (OS). In the present analysis, we examine whether upfront surgical resection improves overall survival in a large national sample. Objective: To compare survival outcomes among patients with newly diagnosed cT1-2 N1-2b HPV-negative OPSCC when treated with primary surgical resection vs CRT. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was an observational study of factors associated with primary treatment modality were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Overall survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank tests, multivariable Cox regression, and propensity score matching. Statistical tests were 2-sided. Patients newly diagnosed as having cT1-2 N1-2b pathologically confirmed HPV-negative OPSCC in 2010 to 2012 were identified using the National Cancer Data Base, which includes more than 70% of patients newly diagnosed as having cancer in the United States. Exposures: Primary surgical resection vs definitive CRT. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival. Results: We identified 1044 patients, among whom 460 (44.1%) received upfront surgery and 584 (55.9%) received CRT. Median age was 59 years (range, 25-90 years); 812 patients were male (77.8%), 232 were female (22.2%). Median follow-up was 30 months. Approximately 59% of surgical patients received adjuvant CRT. On multivariable Cox regression, upfront surgery was not associated with increased OS when compared with CRT (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.74-1.39; P   =   .93). Propensity score-matching identified a cohort of 822 patients and redemonstrated equivalent OS (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.81-1.62; P   =   .46). Lack of OS benefit with upfront surgery persisted in a subset analysis of patients with margin-negative resection (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.66-1.45; P   =   .88). Conclusions and Relevance: In this observational study, OS was similar for patients with HPV-negative OPSCC when treated with primary surgery vs CRT. Most surgical patients received trimodal therapy with adjuvant CRT. Our data may have implications for future research focusing on optimal patient selection for surgery.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cell (CAR T) is a promising therapeutic option for patients with cancer. Such an approach requires the identification of tumor-specific antigen targets that are expressed in solid tumors. We developed a new third-generation CAR directed against tissue factor (TF), a surface molecule overexpressed in some types of lung cancer, melanoma and other cancers. First, we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that TF was overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma using a human tissue microarray. In the presence of TF-positive cancer cells, the CAR-modified T cells (TF-CAR T) were highly activated and showed specific cytotoxicity to TF-positive cancer cells in vitro. In established s.c. xenograft and lung metastasis models, TF-CAR T cells could significantly suppress the growth of s.c. xenograft and metastasis of TF-positive cancer cells. Additionally, the safety evaluation of TF-CAR T cells in vivo showed that the treatment did not cause obvious toxicity in mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that TF-CAR T cells might be a novel potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with TF-positive cancers.</text>

<text>The role of changes in maximum standardized uptake value of FDG PET-CT for post-treatment surveillance in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy: Preliminary findings.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>211</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: No clear consensus exists regarding the optimal interval and frequency of follow-up PET-CT in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Here we sought to clarify whether the changes in the maximum standardized uptake value (  SUVmax) may be a valid parameter to help decision-making for surveillance management after CRT. METHODS: Forty patients underwent PET-CT at pretreatment and 3 months after CRT. Patients were followed by sequential PET-CT for 2 years after CRT. The   SUVmax of the primary tumour and the metastatic nodes were calculated between pretreatment and 3 months after the CRT, and we evaluated the associations between   SUVmax and the manifestation of recurrence, time to recurrence, and the patients' survival. RESULTS: The   SUVmax of the primary tumour was significantly lower for the lesions with recurrence compared to those with nonrecurrence for both the primary site and the nodal site (p=0.007, 0.02). A significant correlation was found between the time to recurrence and the   SUVmax of the primary tumour (r=0.63, p&lt;0.05). The threshold   SUVmax of the primary tumour of 1.04 revealed 76.9% sensitivity and 86.4% specificity for distinguishing recurrence from nonrecurrence. The progression-free survival and overall survival of the two patients groups divided by the   SUVmax of the primary tumour at 1.04 showed a significant difference (p=0.003, 0.02). The   SUVmax of the metastatic nodes did not show a significant association with recurrence or patient survival. CONCLUSION: The   SUVmax of the primary tumour showed a significant association with recurrence and patient survival. Advances in knowledge: The   SUVmax of the primary tumour may be a valid clinical parameter to help decision-making for the surveillance management of HNSCC patients after CRT.</text>

<text>Evaluation of proposed staging systems for human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>110</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) have improved survival when compared with those with HPV-negative OPC. Unfortunately, the American Joint Committee on Cancer seventh edition (AJCC-7ed) staging system does not account for the prognostic advantage observed with HPV-positive OPC. The purpose of the current study was to validate and compare 2 recently proposed staging systems for HPV-positive OPC. METHODS: Patients treated for HPV-positive OPC from 2005 to 2015 at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) were included for analysis. The International Collaboration on Oropharyngeal cancer Network for Staging (ICON-S) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) staging systems were applied and survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to determine the relationship between stage of disease and survival. Models were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). RESULTS: A total of 435 patients were eligible for analysis. There was a dramatic shift in lymph node category and overall stage of disease when ICON-S and MDACC stage were applied to the JHH cohort. There was superior stratification of overall survival and progression-free survival by ICON-S stage. Both proposed models had an improved fit based on AIC scores (P&lt;.001 for both) over the AJCC-7ed. The ICON-S staging system had the lowest AIC score, and thus a better fit within the JHH population. CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis provides external validation for both staging systems in an independent and heterogeneously treated patient population. Although the MDACC staging system is an improvement over the AJCC-7ed, the ICON-S stage provides superior stratification of overall and progression-free survival, thereby supporting its use as the updated AJCC staging system for OPC.

<text>Brain metastasis from nonnasopharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A case series and review of literature.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>118</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Brain metastasis from primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is infrequent and probably under-reported thereby leading to paucity of information. METHODS: Archives of two institutes in India were studied from 2005 to 2013 and relevant information regarding patient demographics, treatment details, and follow-up was obtained for patients having brain metastasis (BM) from HNSCC. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 20 (IBM Corporation, NY, USA). RESULTS: Metastasis to the brain was detected in 17 patients with an HNSCC primary. The median age for diagnosis of index primary was 55 years (range (R) - 32-71 years) with 88% (15/17) being male. Oral cavity was the most common site of primary disease with 35% (6/17) followed by larynx (24%), oropharynx (18%), and hypopharynx (18%). The median stage at presentation was IVA (47%) and two (12%) were metastatic to the brain at presentation. Human papillomavirus analysis was not available for any of the patients. Neurological symptoms were complained of in 94% patients. The median BM-free-interval was 15 months (R - 1-67 months, SE    5.2). While 88% had multiple brain metastases, 82% also had extracranial metastasis and in 53% of patients, the index primary was not controlled. The median overall survival of all patients after the development of BM was 2 months (R - 0.5-6 months, SE    0.4). CONCLUSION: BM in HNSCC is mostly multiple, associated with extracranial metastasis and can occur in patients without locoregional relapse or residual disease and carries a dismal outcome.</text>

<text>Elective neck dissection versus observation in early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma: recurrence and survival.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>113</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the results of elective neck dissection versus those of observation in the treatment of early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma and to identify factors related to recurrence and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 52 patients who underwent elective neck dissection and 27 who did not receive neck dissection. RESULTS: In survival analyses, elective neck dissection showed a benefit in overall recurrence (P=0.027), especially in stage I patients (P=0.024). With regard to survival, the benefit was statistically insignificant (P=0.990). In multivariable analysis, overall recurrence was independently related to poor histologic grade (odds ratio [OR]=9.65, P=0.006), and cancer-specific death was independently related to advanced age (OR=6.3, P=0.022), higher clinical T stage (OR=15.2, P=0.01), and poorly differentiated histologic grade (OR=6.6, P=0.025). CONCLUSION: Though there was lower recurrence in the elective neck dissection group, there were no statistically significant results on survival. The characteristics of the tumor itself, such as clinical T stage and poor histologic grade, may be more important in cancer-specific survival.</text>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three OSCC cell lines, YD-8 (p53 point mutation), YD-9 (p53 wild type), and YD-38 (p53 deletion) were used. To determine the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin, MTS assay was performed. The cell cycle alteration and apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of cell cycle alteration- or apoptosis-related proteins as well as p53. RESULTS: Cisplatin showed a time- and dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect in all cell lines. Cisplatin induced G2/M cell accumulation in the three cell lines after treatment with 0.5 and 1.0   g/mL of cisplatin for 48 hours. The proportion of annexin V-FITC-stained cells increased following treatment with cisplatin. The apoptotic proportion was lower in the YD-38 cell line than in the YD-9 or YD-8 cell lines. Also, immunoblotting analysis indicated that p53 and p21 were detected only in YD-8 and YD-9 cell lines after cisplatin treatment. CONCLUSION: In this study, cisplatin showed anti-cancer effects via G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis, with some difference among OSCC cell lines. The mutation status of p53 might have influenced the difference observed among cell lines. Further studies on p53 mutation status are needed to understand the biological behavior and characteristics of OSCCs and to establish appropriate treatment.</text>

<text>Metabolomic analysis identifies differentially produced oral metabolites, including the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Metabolomics represents a promising approach for discovering novel targets and biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here we used metabolomics to identify oral metabolites associated with HNSCC. METHODS: Tumor and adjacent normal tissue from surgical resections and presurgical oral washes as well as oral washes were collected from healthy participants. Metabolites extractions of these samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC/MS), LC/MS/MS and gas chromatography-MS (GC/MS). RESULTS: Among 28 samples obtained from 7 HNSCC cases and 7 controls, 422 metabolites were detected (269 identified and 153 unidentified). Oral washes contained 12 and 23 metabolites in healthy controls and HNSCC patients, respectively, with phosphate and lactate being the most abundant. Small molecules related to energy metabolism were significantly elevated in HNSCC patients compared to controls. Levels of beta-alanine, alpha-hydroxyisovalerate, tryptophan, and hexanoylcarnitine were elevated in HNSCC oral washes compared to healthy controls (range 7.8-12.2-fold). Resection tissues contained 22 metabolites, of which eight were overproduced in tumor by 1.9- to 12-fold compared to controls. TCA cycle analogs 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and 3-GMP were detected exclusively in tumor tissues. Targeted quantification of 2-HG in a representative HNSCC patient showed increase in tumor tissue (14.7   g/mL), but undetectable in normal tissue. Moreover, high levels of 2-HG were detected in HNSCC cell lines but not in healthy primary oral keratinocyte cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Oral metabolites related to energy metabolism were elevated in HNSCC, and acylcarnitine and 2HG may have potential as non-invasive biomarkers. Further validation in clinical studies is warranted.</text>

<text>Old War Scar Revisited.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>23</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: In 1828, Jean Nicholas Marjolin, a French surgeon, first described the findings of a neoplastic development arising from a burn scar, now more commonly referred to as a Marjolin's ulcer. A Marjolin's ulcer describes malignant degeneration in any chronic wound. The majority of cases arises in burn scars and are often latent for decades. Marjolin ulcers have been widely identified in post-war time injuries. These ulcers may arise in almost any anatomical location. We report a case of an 82-year-old male that presented with a painful fluctuating mass on the right arm localized to the site of an old grenade blast injury he sustained many years earlier. While the presentation of these cases may be variable, the significance of proper management of the wounds is essential to optimal patient outcomes. An aggressive course and poor prognosis is associated with Marjolin's ulcers that degenerate into squamous cell carcinoma. Early detection and aggressive treatment/management with wide local excision and prompt coverage yield the best results when treating patients with Marjolin's ulcers.</text>

<text>No Detection of Episomal or Integrated High-Risk Human Papillomavirus in Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinomas among Korean Population.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>127</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is known to be a representative cancer-causing agent in the genital and head and neck regions. Many studies have detected hrHPV DNA in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma. However, hrHPV-etiologic correlation in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma remains unclear. This study is designed to determine the prevalence of episomal or integrated hrHPV DNA in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma among the Korean population. METHODS: Surgically resected nonsmall cell lung carcinoma tissues, including 134 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and 99 cases of adenocarcinoma (ADC), were examined. In situ hybridization (ISH) for detecting episomal or integrated hrHPV DNA was performed using the INFORM HPV III Family 16 Probe (B) in the Ventana-validated assay. Anyplex II HPV28 detection kit based on real-time polymerase  chain reaction was used for HPV DNA detection and genotyping. RESULTS: All members of the study population were of Korean ethnicity. Episomal or integrated hrHPV DNA ISH analysis result was negative in all 233 cases. One SqCC of 89 samples (42 SqCCs and 47 ADCs) was positive for an hrHPV genotype by Anyplex II HPV28 detection kit. CONCLUSION: Our finding did not demonstrate hrHPV-etiologic correlation in primary lung SqCC and ADC in the Korean population.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: As a key regulator in lipid mobilization, AZGP1 has been reported to play a significant role in various cancers. This study was carried out to investigate the role of AZGP1 in the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients in Northern China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through the application of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining, AZGP1 expression in ESCC tissues from Northern China was examined. RESULTS: Decreased expression of AZGP1 was observed in ~60% ESCC patients. AZGP1 downregulation was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.035), advanced clinical stage (P=0.018), poor prognosis for 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS; P&lt;0.001), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS; P=0.016), and metastasis-free survival (MeFS; P=0.014). In addition, Cox multivariate analysis revealed that AZGP1 downregulation remained to be an independent prognosticator for shorter DSS (P=0.001), LRFS (P=0.011), and MeFS (P=0.004). CONCLUSION: AZGP1 might be a candidate tumor suppressor and a potential novel prognostic biomarker for ESCC patients in Northern China.</text>

<text>Immunosuppression Induced by Chronic Inflammation and the Progression to Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>102</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive, invasive malignancy of epithelial origin. The progression from premalignant lesions-oral leukoplakia (OLK) and oral lichen planus (OLP)-to OSCC involves complex inflammatory processes that have not been elucidated. We investigated the roles of inflammatory mediators and infiltrating immunocytes in the pathogenic progression of OLK and OLP to OSCC. The occurrence of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and proinflammatory cytokines were investigated in OLK, OLP, and OSCC tissues. Immunohistochemical staining of CD4, FOXP3, CD68, TGF-b1, IL-10, IL-4, IFN-y, and MCP-1 showed that the occurrence of Tregs and TAMs increased in parallel with disease progression in OLK and OSCC. IL-10 gradually increased during the early stages of OLK and in OSCC. Infiltrating IL-4(+) macrophages were seen with increasing frequency in OLK tissue during the progression of oral dysplasia. Fewer TGF-b1(+) macrophages were seen in OSCC than in OLK and OLP. The expression of IFN-y decreased gradually with the OLK development and had the lowest expression in OSCC. MCP-1 expression did not change significantly during the development of OSCC. The results suggested that the immunosuppression induced by chronic inflammation promotes tumorigenesis in OSCC, rather than initiating it.</text>

<text>Occurrence of malignancies after kidney transplantation in adults: Slovak multicenter experience.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>97</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Malignancies are one of the three major causes of renal recipient  s death with a functioning graft after cardiovascular diseases and infections. Among the variety of risk factors, including conventional and specific to transplant recipients, the duration of immunosuppressive therapy, the intensity of therapy, and the type of immunosuppressive agent all have an impact on development of post-transplant malignancy. The aim of our retrospective study was to document the incidence, the type of malignancies, the patient/graft survival in the group of kidney transplant recipients in Slovak Republic, and to identify the factors which influenced the outcome. We analyzed the data of 1421 patients who underwent renal transplantation from deceased or living donors in the period from 2007 to 2015 in the Slovak transplant centers. The incidence of malignant tumors was 6%, the malignancy was diagnosed in 85 patients at the age of 54.1    9.8 years, more frequently in men (68.2 %; P &lt; 0.0001). The mean time of malignancy occurrence was 45 months after transplantation. The most frequent malignancies were skin cancers- basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in 17.6%, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 8.2%, and malignant melanoma (MM) in 2.4% of patients, followed by non-skin tumors such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 16.5%, cancer of colon in 12.9%, prostatic cancer in 9.4%, breast cancer in 9.4%, cancer of lung in 7.1%, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in 2.4%, cancer of urine bladder in 2.4%, and cancer of sublingual gland in 1.17% of patients. Surgical treatment was used in 40% of patients, chemotherapy in 7.1%, radiotherapy in 2.4%, treatment with biological agents in 15.3%, combined therapy in 29.4% and palliative treatment in 5.9% of patients. 55.3% of patients underwent conversion from other immunosuppressive agents into mTORi at the time of malignancy occurrence. The remission was achieved in 48.2% of patients, 28.2% of patients were in the oncology treatment in the end of the year 2015, and 23.5% of patients died. There was no difference in the kidney function at the time of malignancy occurrence (s-creat 133.7    59.8   mol/l) and one year later (s-creat 131.1    47.9   mol/l) (P = 0.7768). The patients after successful treatment more frequently suffered from BCC (P = 0.0140), did not undergo palliative treatment (P = 0.0033), but were more frequently treated surgically (P &lt; 0.0001).</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The goals of this retrospective cohort study were to compare the results of clinical and pathological TNM staging in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and to determine the impact of the discordance on prognosis and treatment results. A total of 124 patients with laryngeal cancer, primarily indicated for surgical treatment, were enrolled. The concordance or discordance between the clinical and pathological staging was compared with the frequency of cancer relapse and disease-specific survival. Other potential prognostic factors, like age, the stage and location of the primary tumor, the status of neck lymph nodes, histological margins, and an indication for postoperative radiotherapy, were also evaluated. A disparity in at least one component of TNM staging was found in 40 patients (32%). The discordance had significant negative influence on both disease-free survival (DSF) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Other significant negative prognostic factors were the stage of the primary tumor, nodal status and postoperative radiotherapy. Our results indicate that the discordance between clinical and pathological staging affects the results of cancer treatment significantly. Some improvement can be probably achieved with higher preoperative diagnostic method accuracy.</text>

<text>Programmed death-1 ligand 1 and 2 expression in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and their relationship with tumor- infiltrating dendritic cells.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>146</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: The Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) receptor ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are costimulatory molecules that contribute to the negative regulation of T-lymphocyte activation. It is still unclear whether there is correlation between PD-L1 or PD-L2 and tumor infiltrating dendritic cells (TIDCs) in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). The aim of this study was to analyze PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression and dendritic cells (DCs) infiltration in tumor tissue of CSCC patients and investigate their clinical significance. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate the expression of PD-L1, PD-L2, CD1a, and CD83 in 61 CSCC tissues. Immunofluoresence double labeling technique was performed to detect the co-expression of PD-L1 or PD-L2 and CD1a or CD83 in tumor tissues. We found that 25 of 61 cases CSCC (40.98%) exhibited positivity for PD-L1, whereas 37 of 61 cases CSCC (60.66%) exhibited positivity for PD-L2. A higher percentage of CD1a-positive cases were observed on both PD-L1-positive and PD-L2-positive specimens compared with that of CD83-positive cases (92.29% vs 37.60%, 83.20% vs 33.16%). And both the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on CD1a(+) cells were significantly higher than that on CD83(+) cells in tumor tissues of CSCC patients. Furthermore, the expression rate of PD-L1 was associated with UICC stage, and the expression rate of PD-L2 was associated with predominant differentiation and tumor size in CSCC. Our results indicated that higher expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on CD1a(+) cells than that on CD83(+) cells in CSCC tumor tissues may contribute to negative regulation in antitumor immune responses.

<text>Integrated genomic characterization of oesophageal carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>61</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Oesophageal cancers are prominent worldwide; however, there are few targeted therapies and survival rates for these cancers remain dismal. Here we performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of 164 carcinomas of the oesophagus derived from Western and Eastern populations. Beyond known histopathological and epidemiologic distinctions, molecular features differentiated oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas from oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas resembled squamous carcinomas of other organs more than they did oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Our analyses identified three molecular subclasses of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, but none showed evidence for an aetiological role of human papillomavirus. Squamous cell carcinomas showed frequent genomic amplifications of CCND1 and SOX2 and/or TP63, whereas ERBB2, VEGFA and GATA4 and GATA6 were more commonly amplified in adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal adenocarcinomas strongly resembled the chromosomally unstable variant of gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting that these cancers could be considered a single disease entity. However, some molecular features, including DNA hypermethylation, occurred disproportionally in oesophageal adenocarcinomas. These data provide a framework to facilitate more rational categorization of these tumours and a foundation for new therapies.</text>

<text>Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>141</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) closely interact with tumor cells and affect tumor cell behavior in diverse manners. We herein investigated the mechanisms by which cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) affect the functional polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in vitro and in human cancer samples. The expression of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, CD206, HLA-G, CD80, and CD86 was higher in CD14-positive cells co-cultured with the culture supernatants of CAFs established from OSCC specimens (CAF-educated cells) than in control cells. The gene expression level of ARG1, IL10, and TGFB1 was increased in CAF-educated cells. CAF-educated cells suppressed T cell proliferation more strongly than control cells, and the neutralization of TGF-b IL-10, or arginase I significantly restored T cell proliferation. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and TAMs using tissue samples obtained from patients with OSCC. The infiltration of CAFs was associated with the numbers of CD68-positive and CD163-positive macrophages. It also correlated with lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, lymph node involvement, and the TNM stage. The infiltration of CAFs was identified as an independent prognostic factor in OSCC. Our results indicate that CAFs play important roles in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment in OSCC by inducing the protumoral phenotype of TAMs. Therapeutic strategies to reverse CAF-mediated immunosuppression need to be considered.</text>

<text>Clinicopathological significance of survivin expression in patients with cervical cancer: A systematic meta-analysis.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>117</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Survivin has been shown to play an important role in cancer pathogenesis. However, its role in cervical cancer development is still controversial. This study was performed to evaluate the clinical significance of survivin expression in cervical cancer. METHODS: Search of some online electronic databases was conducted to identify available studies. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and analyzed. RESULTS: Finally, 18 eligible studies with 791 cervical cancer patients, 1,013 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions, 199 normal cervical tissues, and 95 samples with chronic cervicitis were identified in this analysis. The pooled OR of survivin expression was found to be significantly higher in the samples from cervical cancer than in those from CIN lesions, normal cervical tissues, and chronic cervicitis. When cervical cancer was compared to CIN lesions, the subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that survivin expression was associated with a risk of cervical cancer in Asians (P &lt; 0.001), but not in Caucasians (P = 0.659). In addition, survivin was significantly more overexpressed in high-grade cervical cancer than in low-grade cervical cancer. Its expression was also more elevated in advanced-stage patients than in early-stage patients, in lymph node metastasis than in lymph node without metastasis, and in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) than in adenocarcinoma (AC). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of survivin may play a key role in the carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis of cervical cancer. However, survivin expression may be involved in the progression of CIN lesions only in the Asian population. Survivin expression is associated with an increased risk of SCC. Additional studies with larger sample sizes are needed in the future to confirm our findings.</text>

<text>Expression of serum microRNA-378 and its clinical significance in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>100</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: Studies have demonstrated that miRNA -378 expressed in various malignant tumors. In the present study, we aim to explore the expression of serum miRNA-378 and its clinical significance in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 127 LSCC patients, 127 vocal cord polyp (VCP) and 130 healthy controls were selected. RESULTS: The miRNA-378 level in LSCC and VCP group was significantly higher compared to healthy control, and LSCC group has the highest miRNA-378 level. The miRNA-378 level was both decreased significantly in LSCC and VCP group when compared with the same group after surgery. When compared with healthy control, VCP group has a higher miRNA-378 level but has no statistical difference (p&gt;0.05) while LSCC group has a statistical difference (p&lt;0.05) higher miRNA-378 compare with healthy control. The miRNA-378 expression is correlated with clinical stage and differentiation degree, but did not correlate with patient's age, gender distribution, operation mode, and tumor diameter. The AUC of miRNA-378 was 0.888, 95% confidence interval was 0.849 to 0.929, and AUC hypothesis testing was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: miRNA-378 could be used in the diagnosis and the prediction of the postoperative curative effect of laryngeal cancer (LSCC).</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: The inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family are reported to play important roles in cancer cells evading apoptosis. However, the significance of their expression in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells remains uncertain. AIMS: The present study aimed to investigate the role of the IAP family members in tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)-induced apoptosis of human ESCC cells. METHODS: Five human ESCC cell lines were pretreated with TNF-a, cycloheximide (CHX, protein synthesis inhibitor), epoxomicin (proteasome inhibitor). Apoptosis assay and protein study with Western blot testing were conducted. Knockdown experiments with IAP siRNA were conducted, and the effect on cell apoptosis was analyzed. RESULTS: Significant apoptosis was induced in five ESCC cell lines by TNF-a plus CHX stimulation, but not when treated with TNF-a or CHX alone. The protein expression levels of cIAP1 and XIAP were decreased by treatment with TNF-a in the presence of CHX, and the degree of cIAP1 and XIAP expression decrease was correlated with sensitivity to TNF-a plus CHX-induced apoptosis. Epoxomicin suppressed TNF-a plus CHX-induced degradation of survivin, cIAP1, and XIAP, in addition to apoptosis. A caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) suppressed TNF-a plus CHX-induced apoptosis, but did not suppress degradation of survivin, cIAP1, and XIAP. Furthermore, cIAP1 or XIAP siRNA transfected cells underwent apoptosis in response to treatment with TNF-a alone. Double knockdown of both genes resulted in further increased apoptosis. CONCLUSION: cIAP1 and XIAP play an essential role in the resistance of ESCC cells against apoptosis.</text>

<text>Primary transoral robotic surgery with concurrent neck dissection for early stage oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma implemented at a Danish head and neck cancer center: a phase II trial on feasibility and tumour margin status.</text>
</passage>

<text>UNASSIGNED: There is an increasing incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in the western world due to human papillomavirus (HPV). According to the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group guidelines, the current recommended treatment of patients with OPSCC in Denmark is primary radiation therapy (RT) with or without concomitant chemotherapy. This is the first study in Scandinavia from a head and neck cancer centre that aims to demonstrate the feasibility of performing primary transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and concurrent neck dissection for patients with early stage OPSCC. Between September 2014 and January 2016, 30 consecutive patients with clinical T1-T2, N0-N1 OPSCC underwent primary TORS and concurrent neck dissection. The patients were offered postoperative adjuvant therapy according to pathological risk parameters: pT &gt;2, T-site margin &lt;2  mm, pN &gt;1 or extracapsular extension (ECE). Concomitant chemotherapy was offered to patients with the presence of ECE or involved margins. Twenty-nine patients had negative margins on T-site after primary resection. Only one patient had a close margin of 1  mm. Unilateral neck dissection was performed in 21 patients while nine patients underwent bilateral neck dissection. Due to an upstaging following surgery, 13 patients were referred to adjuvant therapy. Four of these patients received RT and two patients received concomitant chemo-radiation (CCR) therapy. Seven patients declined the recommended adjuvant therapy one of whom later developed an N-site recurrence and received salvage surgery with postoperative RT. In summary, 43% of the patients were referred to adjuvant therapy following primary surgery which was mainly due to N-site stage migration and ECE. Primary TORS and concurrent neck dissection is a safe and feasible procedure that may be an alternative to primary RT and CCR in a selected group of patients with early stage OPSCC.</text>

<text>An ovarian mature cystic teratoma evolving in squamous cell carcinoma: A case report and review of the literature.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>114</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Mature cystic teratomas (MCT), also known as dermoid cysts, are the most common ovarian germ cell tumors and the most common ovarian neoplasms in patients younger than 20  years. Malignant transformation (MT) is a rare complication of MCTs which may occur in 1-2% of the cases. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most frequent histology arising from MCTs and its appearance depends on diverse risk factors such as patient's age, the size of the tumor and levels of serum tumor markers. Diagnosis and treatment constitute a big challenge due to the rarity and the aggressive course of this entity. Adjuvant chemotherapy has a leading role in the treatment of MCT-arising SCC, while the use of radiotherapy or chemoradiation is still under consideration. Herein, we report a case of a post-menopausal woman, presenting with mild symptoms and a large pelvic mass deriving from the left ovary occurring as dermoid cyst. Simultaneously, we review the literature stressing out the prognostic factors and the treatment options for MCT arising SCC according to traditional and new therapy-strategies.</text>

<text>Intestinal Type Adenocarcinoma from Inverted Papilloma: A Rare Recurrence.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>74</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Inverted Papilloma (IP) is an uncommon and locally aggressive benign tumour of sinonasal region, which tends to recur after surgical resection. Most tumours are confined to the lateral nasal wall and sinuses, with maxillary sinus being most commonly affected and a male preponderance. It has a known association with in situ and invasive carcinomas with a &lt;10% rate of malignant transformation. Most common association has been seen with squamous cell carcinoma and extremely rare association with adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma. A 36-year-old male presented with a left sided polypoidal nasal mass and underwent a polypectomy. Pathology results showed IP with mild dysplasia. The polypoidal growth reappeared on the same side after a period of 10 months and on histopathological examination, the growth revealed features of intestinal type adenocarcinoma. IP recurring as adenocarcinoma is rare and even after exhaustive literature search only few cases could be found. Two studies have described recurrence of adenocarcinoma in existing IP previously. We report an unusual case of inverted papilloma showing malignant transformation into an intestinal type adenocarcinoma in a 36-year-old male patient within 10 months of previous surgery.</text>

<text>Acute Marjolin's Ulcer in a Postauricular Scar after Mastoidectomy.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>72</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Background. Marjolin's ulcer is a rare, aggressive cutaneous malignancy that arises primarily in burn scars but can occur in other types of scars. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common variant, and while malignant degeneration usually takes a long time, it can develop acutely. Case Report. a 30-year-old man who developed Marjolin's ulcer acutely in a right postauricular scar after mastoidectomy and the incision and drainage of a mastoid abscess. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe a Marjolin's ulcer in a postauricular surgical scar. However, it has been reported in others areas in the head and neck. Conclusion. Marjolin's ulcer is most commonly observed after postburn scars, but it may be observed after any type of scars, as our patient developed an SCC with a postsurgical scar. Early diagnosis is essential, and a biopsy should be performed on any nonhealing wound or chronic wound that undergoes a sudden change. Tissue samples should be taken from both the centre and the margins of the wound.</text>

<text>Evaluating tumour after care in oral squamous cell carcinoma: Insights into patients' health related quality of life.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>122</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: Tumour aftercare (tac) is an essential tool in oncology. The main aim of these follow ups is to diagnose recurrence and second tumours from the beginning. Tac appointments can create a special environment for patients' further concerns. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate tac of patients diagnosed with OSCC and to investigate their health related quality of life (hrql). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A German questionnaire was created by two maxillo-facial surgeons with several years of tac experience. It was handed out to 100 German-speaking OSCC patients during tac. Results were statistically evaluated with SPSS (SPSS version 21.0; SPSS, IBM; Chicago, IL, USA). The inclusion criterion was that diagnosis and surgery were performed at our department and that the patients attended our tac regularly. RESULTS: Side effects such as difficulties in speaking and swallowing were evaluated as being significantly higher in cases who were administered adjuvant radiochemotherapy (art) compared with the surgical therapy group (stg) (p  =  0.03). Anxiety occurred in 80% of all female patients (p  =  0.02), 90% of them with a high psychological strain because of the cancer diagnosis (p  =  0.04). DISCUSSION: To date, tac is a rare topic in literature. Moreover, only a few trials have focused on hrql in OSCC. A main result of the current study is that during tac, OSCC patients should be regularly questioned about their symptoms and mental state. Further, the need of the majority of OSCC patients for coping therapies can concomitantly be evaluated. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of tac is of high relevance. The results of the current study have encouraged us to establish this questionnaire as a routine tool in our tac.</text>

<text>SU-F-J-215: Non-Thermal Pulsed High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Therapy Combined with 5-Aminolevulinic Acid: An in Vivo Pilot Study.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>133</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: It has recently been shown that non-thermal pulsed high intensity focused ultrasound (pHIFU) has a cell-killing effect. The purpose of the study is to investigate the sonosensitizing effect of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) in non-thermal pHIFU cancer therapy. METHODS: FaDu human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells were injected subcutaneously in the flanks of nude mice. After one to two weeks, the tumors reached the volume of 112    8 mm3 and were assigned randomly into a non-thermal pHIFU group (n=9) and a non-thermal sonodynamic therapy (pHIFU after 5-ALA administration) group (n=7). The pHIFU treatments (parameters: 1 MHz frequency; 25 W acoustic power; 0.1 duty cycle; 60 seconds duration) were delivered using an InSightec ExAblate 2000 system with a GE Signa 1.5T MR scanner. The mice in the non-thermal sonodynamic group received 5-ALA tail-vein injection 4 hours prior to the pHIFU treatment. The tumor growth was monitored using the CT scanner on a Sofie-Biosciences G8 PET/CT system. RESULTS: The tumors in this study grew very aggressively and about 60% of the tumors in this study developed ulcerations at various stages. Tumor growth delay after treatments was observed by comparing the treated (n=9 in pHIFU group; n=7 in sonodynamic group) and untreated tumors (n=17). However, no statistically significant differences were found between the non-thermal pHIFU and non-thermal sonodynamic group. The mean normalized tumor volume of the untreated tumors on Day 7 after their first CT scans was 7.05    0.54, while the normalized volume of the treated tumors on Day 7 after treatment was 5.89    0.79 and 6.27    0.47 for the sonodynamic group and pHIFU group, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, no significant sonosensitizing effects of 5-ALA were obtained on aggressive FaDu tumors despite apparent tumor growth delay in some mice treated with non-thermal sonodynamic therapy.</text>

<text>PURPOSE: To estimate the radiobiological parameters of four NTCP models that describe the dose-response relations of pharyngeal constrictors and proximal esophagus regarding the severity of patient reported swallowing problems 6 months post chemo-radiotherapy. To identify the section/structure that best correlates with the manifestation of the clinical endpoints. Finally, to compare the goodness-of-fit of those models. METHODS: Forty-three patients were treated on a prospective multi-institutional phase II study for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. All the patients received 60 Gy IMRT and they reported symptoms using the novel patient reported outcome version of the CTCAE. We derived the individual patient dosimetric data of superior, medium and inferior sections of pharyngeal constrictors (SPC, MPC and IPC), superior and inferior sections of esophagus (SES and IES) as separate structures as well as combinations. The Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB), Relative Seriality (RS), Logit and Relative Logit (RL) NTCP models were used to fit the patient data. The fitting of the different models was assessed through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Odds Ratio methods. RESULTS: The AUC values were highest for the SPC for Grade &gt;=  2 (0.719 for the RS and RL models, and 0.716 for LKB and Logit). For Grade &gt;=  1, the respective values were 0.699 for RS, LKB and Logit and 0.676 for RL. For MPC the AUC values varied between 0.463-0.477, for IPC between 0.396-0.458, for SES between 0.556-0.613 and for IES between 0.410-0.519. The Odds Ratio for the SPC was 15.6 (1.7-146.4) for RS, LKB and Logit for NTCP of 55%. CONCLUSION: All the examined NTCP models could fit the clinical data with similar accuracy. The SPC appear to correlate best with the clinical endpoints of swallowing problems. A prospective study could establish the use of NTCP values of SPC as a constraint in treatment planning.</text>

<text>SU-D-204-04: Correlations Between Dosimetric Indices and Follow-Up Data for Salivary Glands Six Months After Radiation Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer.</text>
</passage>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>152</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between different dosimetric indices of salivary glands (as separate or combined structures) to patient-reported dry mouth 6 months post radiotherapy using the novel patient reported outcome version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE). METHODS: Forty-three patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma were treated on a prospective multi-institutional study. All patients received de-intensified 60 Gy intensity modulated radiotherapy. Dosimetric constraints were used for the salivary glands (e.g. mean dose to the contralateral-parotid &lt; 26 Gy). We investigated correlations of individual patient dosimetric data of the parotid and submandibular glands (as separate or combined structures) to their self-reported 6 month post-treatment dry mouth responses. Moderate dry mouth responses were most prevalent and were used as the clinical endpoint indicating response. The correlation of Dmean, Dmax and a range of dosevolume (VD) points were assessed through the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and Odds Ratios (OR). RESULTS: Patients reporting non/mild dry mouth response (N=22) had average Dmean = 19.6    6.2Gy to the contralateral-parotid compared to an average Dmean = 28.0    8.3Gy and an AUC = 0.758 for the patients reporting moderate/severe/very severe dry mouth (N=21). Analysis of the range of VD's for patients who had reported dry mouth showed that for the contralateral-parotid the indices V18 through V22 had the highest area under the curves (AUC) (0.762 - 0.772) compared to a more traditional dosimetric index V30, which had an AUC = 0.732. The highest AUC was observed for the combination of contralateral parotid and contralateral submandibular glands, for which V16 through V28 had AUC = 0.801 - 0.834. CONCLUSION: Patients who report moderate/severe/very severe dry mouth 6 months post radiotherapy had on average higher Dmean. The V16-V28 of the combination of the contralateral glands showed the highest correlation with the clinical endpoint.</text>

<text>SU-F-T-682: In-Vivo Simulation of the Relative Biological Effectiveness in Proton Therapy Using a Monte Carlo Method.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>117</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: In proton therapy, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) - compared with conventional photon therapy - is routinely set to 1.1. However, experimental in vitro studies indicate evidence for the variability of the RBE. To clarify the impact on patient treatment, investigation of the RBE in a preclinical case study should be performed. METHODS: The Monte Carlo software TOPAS was used to simulate the radiation field of an irradiation setup at the experimental beamline of the proton therapy facility (OncoRay) in Dresden, Germany. Simulations were performed on cone beam CT-data (CBCT) of a xenogeneous mouse with an orthotopic lung carcinoma obtained by an in-house developed small animal image-guided radiotherapy device. A homogeneous physical fraction dose of 1.8Gy was prescribed for the contoured tumor volume. Simulated dose and linear energy transfer distributions were used to estimate RBE values in the mouse based on an RBE model by Wedenberg et al. To characterize radiation sensitivity of normal and tumor tissue, a/b-ratios were taken from the literature for NB1RGB (10.1Gy) and human squamous lung cancer (6.2Gy) cell lines, respectively. RESULTS: Good dose coverage of the target volume was achieved with a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP). The contra-lateral lung was completely spared from receiving radiation. An increase in RBE towards the distal end of the SOBP from 1.07 to 1.35 and from 1.05 to 1.3 was observed when considering normal tissue and tumor, respectively, with the highest RBE values located distal to the target volume. CONCLUSION: Modeled RBE values simulated on CBCT for experimental preclinical proton therapy varied with tissue type and depth in a mouse and differed therefore from a constant value of 1.1. Further translational work will include, first, conducting preclinical experiments and, second, analogous RBE studies in patients using experimentally verified simulation settings for our clinically used patient-specific beam conforming technique.</text>

</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>102</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: To treat squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma of the skin with the Freiburg flap applicator using a high dose rate modality of an Elekta Flexitron or MicroSelectron for radiation delivery by compensating the dose deviation resulting from the incomplete scatter environment. METHODS: Patients were selected to have lesions greater than or equal to 2cm. A mask might be needed depending on special locations. The lesions on the eyelid and face presented in this research were, however, treated without a mask. Cutting the flap into a shape conformal to the target and attaching it to the mask were used in order to make the treatment reproducible. Patients were scanned with a Philips Big Bore Brilliant CT. A 1cm margin was added to the lesion. An Elekta Oncentra Brachy treatment planning system ver. 4.3 was used for treatment planning. 40 Gy in 10 or 8 fractions was prescribed to the 1cm depth. The Freiburg flap was aligned and verified by CT scanning prior to treatment. RESULTS: Three patients with squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma of the skin were treated with the Freiburg flap applicator. Lesion sizes ranged from 2cm to 6 cm in a maximum dimension. With treatment planning, we made a dose correction for compensating the dose deviation resulting from the incomplete scatter environment of the flap applicators exposed to air. The flap was also covered by a 4cm bolus in order to obtain more back scattered radiation during treatment. Six month follow up showed a very good cosmetic result. CONCLUSION: The Freiburg flap brachytherapy offers a non-invasive skin cancer treatment with a high skin dose delivered to the tumor while a low dose sparing the surrounding health tissue. It is a promising alternative to skin cancer surgery or external beam radiation therapy.</text>

<text>SU-F-J-223: Patterns of Failure for Laryngeal Cancer Patients Treated with Definitive IMRT: Comparing Two Different Methods for Determining the Origin of Recurrence From Follow-Up PET/CT Scans.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>193</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: To determine patterns of failure in laryngeal cancer treated with definitive IMRT by comparing two different methods for identifying the recurrence epicenter on follow-up PET/CT. METHODS: We identified 20 patients treated for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with definitive IMRT who had loco-regional recurrence diagnosed on PET/CT. Recurrence PET/CT scans were co-registered with the original treatment planning CT using deformable image registration with the VoxAlign deformation engine in MIM Software. Recurrence volumes were delineated on co-registered follow-up scans using a semi-automatic PETedge tool and two separate methods were used to identify the recurrence point of origin: a) Finding the point within the recurrence volume for which the maximum distance to the surface of the surrounding recurrence volume is smaller than for any other point. b) Finding the point within the recurrence volume with the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), without geometric restrictions.For each method the failure pattern was determined as whether the recurrence origin fell within the original high-dose target volumes GTV70, CTV70, PTV70 (receiving 70Gy), intermediate-risk PTV59 (receiving 59.4Gy) or low-risk PTV54 (receiving 54.1Gy), in the original treatment planning CT. RESULTS: 23 primary/nodal recurrences from the 20 patients were analyzed. The three-dimensional distance between the two different origins was on average 10.5mm (std.dev. 10mm). Most recurrences originated in the high-dose target volumes for both methods with 13 (57%) and 11 (48%) in the GTV70 and 20 (87%) and 20 (87%) in the PTV70 for method a) and b), respectively. There was good agreement between the two methods in classifying the origin target volumes with 69% concordance for GTV70, 89% for CTV70 and 100% for PTV70. CONCLUSION: With strong agreement in patterns of failure between two separate methods for determining recurrence origin, we conclude that most recurrences occurred within the high-dose treatment region, which influences potential risk-adaptive treatment strategies.</text>

<text>SU-G-IeP4-11: Monitoring Tumor Growth in Subcutaneous Murine Tumor Model in Vivo: A Comparison Between MRI and Small Animal CT.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>127</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to compare the volume measurement of subcutaneous tumors in mice with different imaging platforms, namely a GE MRI and a Sofie-Biosciences small animal CT scanner. METHODS: A549 human lung carcinoma cells and FaDu human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells were implanted subcutaneously into flanks of nude mice. Three FaDu tumors and three A549 tumors were included in this study. The MRI scans were done with a GE Signa 1.5 Tesla MR scanner using a fast T2-weighted sequence (70mm FOV and 1.2mm slice thickness), while the CT scans were done with the CT scanner on a Sofie-Biosciences G8 PET/CT platform dedicated for small animal studies (48mm FOV and 0.2mm slice thickness). Imaging contrast agent was not used in this study. Based on the DICOM images from MRI and CT scans, the tumors were contoured with Philips DICOM Viewer and the tumor volumes were obtained by summing up the contoured area and multiplied by the slice thickness. RESULTS: The volume measurements based on the CT scans agree reasonably with that obtained with MR images for the subcutaneous tumors. The mean difference in the absolute tumor volumes between MRI- and CT-based measurements was found to be -6.2%    1.0%, with the difference defined as (VMR - VCT)*100%/VMR. Furthermore, we evaluated the normalized tumor volumes, which were defined for each tumor as V/V0 where V0 stands for the volume from the first MR or CT scan. The mean difference in the normalized tumor volumes was found to be 0.10%    0.96%. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that the difference between normal and abnormal tissues is often less clear on small animal CT images than on MR images, one can still obtain reasonable tumor volume information with the small animal CT scans for subcutaneous murine xenograft models.</text>

<text>SU-F-T-454: Dose-Mass-Histogram Sensitivity to Anatomical Changes During Radiotherapy for HNSCC.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>96</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: To determine the sensitivity of dose-mass-histogram (DMH) due to anatomical changes of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) radiotherapy (RT). METHODS: Eight patients undergoing RT treatment for HNSCC were scanned during the third and sixth week of RT. These second (CT2) and third (CT3) CTs were co-registered to the planning CT (CT1). Contours were propagated via deformable registration from CT1 and doses were re-calculated. DMHs were extracted for each CT set. DMH sensitivity was assessed by dose-mass indices (DMIs), which represent the dose delivered to a certain mass of and anatomical structure. DMIs included: dose to 98%, 95% and 2% of the target masses (PTV1, PTV2, and PTV3) and organs-at-risk (OARs): cord DMI2%, brainstem DMI2%, left_ and right_parotid DMI2% and DMI50%, and mandible DMI2%. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to compare changes to DMIs in CT2 and CT3 with respect to CT1 (CT2/CT1 and CT3/CT1). RESULTS: Changes to DMHs were found for all OARs and PTVs, but they were significant only for the PTVs. Maximum dose to PTVs increased significantly for CT2/CT1 in all three PTVs, but CT3/CT1 changes were only significantly different for PTV1 and PTV2. Dose coverage to the three PTVs was also significantly different, DMI98% was lower for both CT2/CT1 and CT3/CT1. DMI95% was significantly lower for PTV1 for CT2/CT1, PTV2 for CT2/CT1 and CT3/CT1, and PTV3 for CT3/CT1. CONCLUSION: Changes in anatomy significantly change dose-mass coverage for the planning targets, making it necessary to re-plan in order to maintain the therapeutic goals. Maximum dose to the PTVs increase significantly as RT progresses, which may not be problematic as long as the high dose remains in the gross tumor volume. Doses to OARs were minimally affected and the differences were not significant.</text>

<text>SU-F-R-07: Radiomics of CT Features and Associations and Correlation with Outcomes Following Lung SBRT.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>103</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic significance of image gradients and in predicting clinical outcomes in a patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on 71 patients with 83 treated lesions. METHODS: The records of patients treated with lung SBRT were retrospectively reviewed. When applicable, SBRT target volumes were modified to exclude any overlap with pleura, chestwall, or mediastinum. The ITK software package was utilized to generate quantitative measures of image intensity, inhomogeneity, shape morphology and first and second-order CT textures. Multivariate and univariate models containing CT features were generated to assess associations with clinicopathologic factors. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, tumor size (HR 0.54, p=0.045) sumHU (HR 0.31, p=0.044) and short run grey level emphasis STD (HR 0.22, p=0.019) were associated with regional failure-free survival; meanHU (HR 0.30, p=0.035), long run emphasis (HR 0.21, p=0.011) and long run low grey level emphasis (HR 0.14, p=0.005) was associated with distant failure-free survival (DFFS). No features were significant on multivariate modeling however long run low grey level emphasis had a hazard ratio of 0.12 (p=0.061) for DFFS. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma differed with respect to long run emphasis STD (p=0.024), short run low grey level emphasis STD (p&lt;0.001), and long run low grey level emphasis STD (p=0.024). Multivariate modeling of texture features associated with tumor histology was used to estimate histologies of 18 lesions treated without histologic confirmation. Of these, MVA suggested the same histology as a prior metachronous lung malignancy in 3/7 patients. CONCLUSION: Extracting radiomics features on clinical datasets was feasible with the ITK package with minimal effort to identify pre-treatment quantitative CT features with prognostic factors for distant control after lung SBRT.</text>

<text>WE-FG-202-12: Investigation of Longitudinal Salivary Gland DCE-MRI Changes.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>75</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: To determine the correlation between dose and changes through treatment in dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI voxel parameters (Ktrans, kep, Ve, and Vp) within salivary glands of head and neck oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. METHODS: 17 HNSCC patients treated with definitive radiation therapy completed DCE-MRI scans on a 3T scanner at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment time points. Mid-treatment and post-treatment DCE images were deformably registered to pre-treatment DCE images (Velocity software package). Pharmacokinetic analysis of the DCE images used a modified Tofts model to produce parameter maps with an arterial input function selected from each patient's perivertebral space on the image (NordicICE software package). In-house software was developed for voxel-by-voxel longitudinal analysis of the salivary glands within the registered images. The planning CT was rigidly registered to the pre-treatment DCE image to obtain dose values in each voxel. Voxels within the lower and upper dose quartiles for each gland were averaged for each patient, then an average of the patients' means for the two quartiles were compared. Dose-relationships were also assessed by Spearman correlations between dose and voxel parameter changes for each patient's gland. RESULTS: Changes in parameters' means between time points were observed, but inter-patient variability was high. Ve of the parotid was the only parameter that had a consistently significant longitudinal difference between dose quartiles. The highest Spearman correlation was Vp of the sublingual gland for the change in the pre-treatment to mid-treatment values with only a   =0.29. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, there was large inter-patient variability in the changes of DCE voxel parameters with no clear relationship with dose. Additional patients may reduce the uncertainties and allow for the determination of the existence of parameter and dose relationships.</text>

<text>PURPOSE: To estimate the radiobiological parameters of four popular NTCP models that describe the dose-response relations of salivary glands to the severity of patient reported dry mouth 6 months post chemo-radiotherapy. To identify the glands, which best correlate with the manifestation of those clinical endpoints. Finally, to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the NTCP models. METHODS: Forty-three patients were treated on a prospective multiinstitutional phase II study for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. All the patients received 60 Gy IMRT and they reported symptoms using the novel patient reported outcome version of the CTCAE. We derived the individual patient dosimetric data of the parotid and submandibular glands (SMG) as separate structures as well as combinations. The Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB), Relative Seriality (RS), Logit and Relative Logit (RL) NTCP models were used to fit the patients data. The fitting of the different models was assessed through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Odds Ratio methods. RESULTS: The AUC values were highest for the contralateral parotid for Grade &gt;=  2 (0.762 for the LKB, RS, Logit and 0.753 for the RL). For the salivary glands the AUC values were: 0.725 for the LKB, RS, Logit and 0.721 for the RL. For the contralateral SMG the AUC values were: 0.721 for LKB, 0.714 for Logit and 0.712 for RS and RL. The Odds Ratio for the contralateral parotid was 5.8 (1.3-25.5) for all the four NTCP models for the radiobiological dose threshold of 21Gy. CONCLUSION: It was shown that all the examined NTCP models could fit the clinical data well with very similar accuracy. The contralateral parotid gland appears to correlated best with the clinical endpoints of severe/very severe dry mouth. An EQD2Gy dose of 21Gy appears to be a safe threshold to be used as a constraint in treatment planning.</text>

<text>SU-G-IeP1-05: Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging for Oropharyngeal Cancer Detection.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>76</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an emerging diffusion MRI technique in cancer diagnosis applications. The objective of this study is to compare DKI with conventional diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) for diagnosis of head and neck cancer. METHODS: Five male patients with histologically documented phase II/III squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx were included in this study. DKI (with 6 b-values of 0-2000 s/mm2) and conventional DWI data were acquired at a 3.0 T GE MRI scanner. Monoexponential (calculating apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using DWI data) and non-Gaussian kurtosis (calculating mean diffusion coefficient (MD) and mean kurtosis coefficient (MK) using DKI data) fits were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis in selected regions of interest (primary tumor, metastatic nodes, contralateral region of tumor (tongue muscle), and submandibular glands). The non-parametric Wilcoxon test of ADC and DKI parameters between primary tumor and tongue muscle in contralateral region of tumor were calculated for comparison. RESULTS: Examples of T1 post-contrast images and diffusion parametric maps (ADC, MD and MK) were illustrated in Figure 1 for an oropharynx cancer patient. MK parameters were significantly higher in the primary tumor than in the contralateral tongue muscle (0.89    0.17 vs 0.68    0.13, respectively; P &lt;.05). MD and ADC in the primary tumor were significantly lower than those in the contralateral tongue muscle (1.20    0.23 vs 2.57    1.01; P &lt;0.02 and 0.88    0.22 vs 1.41    0.18; P &lt;0.01, respectively) (Table 1). Figure 2 showed statistical distribution of DWI and DKI parameters in selected regions of interest (primary tumor, metastatic nodes, tongue muscle, and submandibular glands). CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of this study showed DKI could be a new option for increasing diagnostic confidence of oropharyngeal lesions. We continue to accrue study patients to evaluate the potential correlation between DKI parameters and tumor pathologic factors.</text>

<text>SU-F-T-27: A Comparative Case Study Among Four Modalities for the Superficial Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>115</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: We performed a comparative planning study among High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy, superficial electrons, Volume Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), and Helical IMRT (Tomotherapy) for squamous cell carcinoma of the abdominal wall with consideration for the underlining bowel. METHODS: A 69-year old female presented with squamous cell carcinoma protruding 8mm beyond the anterior skin surface of the midabdomen was considered for treatment. The patient had a ventral hernia which resulted in the reduction of the abdominal wall thickness and the adjacent small bowel being the dose limiting structure. Four plans were generated using different treatment modalities: a) an enface electron field (eMC, Eclipse v. 11), b) Tomotherapy (HI-Art II v.5.0.5), c) VMAT (Acuros, Eclipse v. 11), and d) HDR using a Freiburg applicator (Oncentra v. 4.3). The following plan objectives were used for all four plans: for the CTV target, V90% &gt;= 90% (61.8Gy2/2).For the small bowel, D0.1cc &lt; 56.2 Gy2/2 was a hard constraint and expressed as a percentage of the prescription for comparison to demonstrate the dose fall-off achieved among the modalities.For HDR, V200% &lt;0.1cc was an additional constraint. Multiple dosimetric parameters, including those listed above, were compared among the four modalities. RESULTS: The HDR plan showed comparable target coverage compared to the Tomotherapy plan and better coverage compared to the electron plan. Small bowel doses (D0.1cc) were lower in HDR plan compared to Tomotherapy, electron, _ VMAT plans (88.8%, 89.6%, 90.9%, _ 96.6%). Integral dose to the whole body (V5%) was much higher for HDR, VMAT, and Tomotherapy when compared to electron plan by factors of seven, eight, and ten, respectively. After reviewing all treatment modalities, the physician selected HDR owing to better control of the small bowel dose while maintaining adequate target coverage. CONCLUSION: This case study demonstrated HDR can successfully treat superficial lesions with superior sparing of underlying structures.</text>

<text>SU-F-T-107: Correlations Between Dosimetric Indices of Pharyngeal Constrictors and Proximal Esophagus with Associated Patient-Reported Outcomes Six Months After Radiation Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>204</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: To compare the correlations between different dosimetric indices derived from the pharyngeal constrictor muscles and proximal esophagus with patient-reported difficulty in swallowing 6 months post radiotherapy using a novel patient reported outcome version of CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE). METHODS: Forty-three patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma were treated on a prospective multi-institutional study. All patients received de-intensified 60 Gy intensity modulated radiotherapy. We investigated correlations of individual patient dosimetric data of the superior (SPC), middle (MPC), inferior (IPC) pharyngeal constrictor muscles, the superior esophagus (SES), and the inferior esophagus (IES) to their self-reported 6 month post-treatment swallowing difficulty responses. Mild (&gt;=  Grade 1) swallowing difficulty responses were used as the clinical endpoint indicating response. The predictive efficacy of Dmean and dose-volume (VD) points were assessed through the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and Odds Ratio (OR). RESULTS: The SES and SPC had more favorable area under the curves (AUC) for the Dmean (0.62 and 0.70) while the Dmean to the IPC, MPC, and IES produced suboptimal AUCs (0.42, 0.48, and 0.52). Additionally, over the range of VD, the V54 and V55 for the SES and SPC demonstrated the highest AUCs: AUC(SES) = 0.76-0.73 and AUC(SPC) = 0.72-0.69, respectively. The IES, IPC, and MPC had worse AUC results over the range of VD. An optimal OR can be found when V54 = 96% for the SPC, where OR = 3.96 (1.07-14.62). CONCLUSION: The V45 and V55 of the SES and SPC had the highest correlation to the clinical endpoint compared to the commonly used dosimetric index, Dmean for both the esophagus and constrictor muscles. The reported dosimetric data demonstrates that new dosimetric indices may need to be considered in the setting of dose de-escalation and self-reported outcomes.</text>

<text>SU-F-R-15: Establishing Relevant ADC-Based Texture Analysis Metrics for Quantifying Early Treatment-Induced Changes in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>157</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to identify texture analysis metrics from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps that would provide quantifiable changes with treatment in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We discerned which imaging metrics were relevant using baseline agreement and variations during early treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed diffusion-weighted MRI scans in 9 patients with stages II-IV HNSCC. ADC maps were generated from two baseline scans, performed 1 week apart, and one early treatment scan, obtained during the 2nd week of chemoradiation. Regions of interest (ROI) consisting of primary and nodal disease were drawn on the resampled ADC maps. Four 3D texture matrices describing local and regional relationships between voxel intensities in the ROIs were generated. From these, 38 texture metrics and 7 histogram features were calculated for each patient, including the mean and median ADC. To identify metrics with good agreement between baseline studies, we compared all metrics using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). For metrics with ICC &gt;=  0.80, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test if the difference between the mean of the baselines and the early treatment was non-zero. RESULTS: Nine of the 45 metrics had an ICC &gt;=  0.80. Six of these 9 metrics had a p-value &lt; 0.05: run length non-uniformity, ADC median, texture strength, ADC mean, zone percentage, and variance. Only 1 of the 9 metrics remained of interest, after applying the Holm correction to the alpha levels: run length non-uniformity (p = 0.004) in the Gray Level Run Length Matrix. CONCLUSION: The feasibility of texture analysis is dependent on the baseline agreement of each metric, which disqualifies many texture characteristics. Consequently, only a few metrics are reproducible and qualify for future studies that provide quantitative assessment of early treatment changes for HNSCC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Reactive oxygen species (ROS), formed as an indirect production of radiotherapy (RT), could cause DNA damage of normal tissues. Meanwhile, our body possesses the ability to restore the damage by DNA repair pathways. The imbalance between the two systems could finally result in radiation injury. Therefore, in this prospective cohort study, we explored the association of genetic variants in ROS metabolism and DNA repair pathway-related genes with radiation pneumonitis (RP). A total of 265 locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients receiving RT in Chinese Han population were enrolled. Five functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1695 in GSTP1; rs4880 in SOD2; rs3957356 in GSTA1; and rs1801131, rs1801133 in MTHFR) were genotyped using the MassArray system, and rs1801131 was found to be a predictor of &gt;=  2 RP. Our results showed that, compared with TT genotype, patients with GG/GT genotypes of rs1801131 had a notably lower risk of developing &gt;=  2 RP (HR = 0.339, 95% CI = 0.137-0.839, P = 0.019). Further independent studies are required to confirm this findings.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: The fibula flap is a workhorse flap for bony reconstruction of oro-mandibular area and can be modified to include soft tissue for reconstruction of composite defects. However, the design of a reliable skin paddle that can be used for composite tissue reconstruction remains a challenge. The authors described the applicability of perforator concept for a more reliable free osteomusculocutaneous fibula flap. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2015, 29 patients underwent free fibula osteocutaneous flap reconstruction. Twenty-two patients have been operated due to squamous cell carcinoma and 7 patients due to gunshot injuries. RESULTS: The mean harvesting time was 60  15minutes. The range of width of the skin paddle was 3 to 12cm and length was 6 to 23cm. The range of length of bone was 5 to 18cm. One patient had revision due to venous occlusion. All flaps have survived. CONCLUSION: The authors advocate approaching all components of flap individually using the perforator concept and dissection. Good exposure is mandatory for a reliable dissection. In our opinion, the posterior approach is more useful as it reveals all vascular relationships between the bone, muscle, skin paddle, and peronel vessels.</text>

<text>Recalcitrant Invasive Skin Cancer of the Scalp: Combined Extirpation and Microsurgical Reconstruction Without Cranioplasty.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>123</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Recurrent invasive skin cancer of the scalp and calvarium is a difficult problem for which universally accepted treatment protocols have not been established. The authors present their 10-year experience with treatment of this specific subset of scalp reconstruction patients and present a successful treatment algorithm that is well suited to this patient population. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed all patients of microsurgical scalp reconstruction performed from 2005 to 2015 that involved invasive cutaneous malignancies of the scalp and calvarium. RESULTS: Eleven patients met inclusion criteria. There were 9 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 basal cell carcinoma, and 1 melanoma. Seven received radiation prior to resection, 2 were irradiated postoperatively, and 2 were immunosuppressed. Seven had a history of prior scalp reconstruction. The median scalp defect size was 141cm. All the patients underwent craniectomy and the median cranial defect size was 71cm. Cranioplasty was not performed in any patient. There were no intraoperative complications or flap loss. Recipient site complications included hematoma in 1, 1 seroma, 2 cerebral spinal fluid leaks, 3 partial skin graft loss. There was 1 donor site seroma in a patient who had a latissimus dorsi flap. All the patients reported satisfaction with the overall result and none were limited in activities by the existing cranial defect. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest series published to date that focuses exclusively on management of cutaneous malignancies with intracranial invasion. Wide resection with craniectomy, and reconstruction with microvascular free tissue transfer without cranioplasty provides safe and reliable treatment of recalcitrant invasive scalp skin cancers with low morbidity and without major complications. Pre and postoperative radiation is well tolerated with this approach. The patients in this series were of advanced age and of a lifestyle for which cranioplasty is unnecessary for return to regular activities.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Despite a considerable expansion in our therapeutic repertoire for management of other malignancies, mortality from head and neck cancer (HNC) has not significantly improved in recent decades. Upon normalizing National Institutes of Health-awarded R01 and R01-equivalent grants by incidence, thyroid cancer ( 214) and HNC ( 1329) received the fewest funding dollars. Upon adjusting funding totals by mortality, HNC was 7th out of 9 cancers evaluated ( 6138). These findings highlight HNC as an underfunded disease versus other cancers. As data detailing grant applications (including unsuccessful grants) are not publicly available, it is not clear if these disparities stem from fewer applications or fewer opportunities. Our hope is that this commentary will spur further investigation into strategies to increase HNC inquiry and funding for trainees as well as early-stage and established investigators.</text>

<text>Modifying effect of mouse double minute-2 promoter variants on risk of recurrence for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of oropharynx.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>138</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Functional mouse double minute-2 (MDM2) promoter variants may alter MDM2 expression and thus affect radiotherapy response and prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma of oropharynx (SCCOP). Thus we assessed association of 2 functional MDM2 promoter variants with recurrence risk of SCCOP. The disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with MDM2rs2279744 TT or MDM2rs937283 AA genotypes was significantly reduced compared with that of patients with corresponding GT/GG or AG/GG genotypes. Multivariable analysis showed patients with TT or AA genotypes had a significantly higher risk of SCCOP recurrence than those with corresponding GT/GG or AG/GG genotypes did. Furthermore, patients with combined risk genotypes of the 2 polymorphisms had significantly worse DFS and a higher recurrence risk than patients with fewer combined risk genotypes did (Ptrend &lt; 0.001). Compared with patients with 0 risk genotypes, patients with 1 or 2 risk genotypes had an approximately 3- or 11-fold increased risk of SCCOP recurrence, respectively. Notably, for both individual and combined polymorphisms, the above similar recurrence risks were particularly higher among patients with human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive tumors. Taken together, our findings suggest that MDM2 promoter variants individually, or more likely jointly, play a role in determining the risk of recurrence of SCCOP, particularly HPV-positive SCCOP.</text>

<text>Rate of positive diagnosis of skin cancer and its stage in two-week wait referrals in England according to age.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>111</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The incidence of skin cancer is increasing. The two-week wait conversion rate (TWWCR) is the percentage of urgent suspected skin cancer referrals that are confirmed as cancer. AIMS: To examine the relationships between different epidemiological factors and TWWCR for malignant melanoma (MM) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: We extracted data from the National Cancer Data Repository (NCDR) and National Cancer Waiting Times Monitoring Dataset between 2009 and 2010 for MM and SCC in England. We conducted partial correlation and stepwise multiple regression analysis on TWWCR, age, incidence, detection rate, tumour thickness (MM only), percentage MM/SCC and social deprivation. We also looked at the two-week wait referral rate (TWWRR) and incidence rate with respect to age. RESULTS: TWWCR was significantly correlated with age when partial correlation was used to control for the factors described above for MM (P &lt; 0.05) and SCC (P &lt; 0.001). Stepwise regression of these factors returned only age as significant in the final model for MM (P &lt; 0.001) and SCC (P &lt; 0.01). Incidence of MM and SCC increased with age. TWWRR also increase with age, but with higher rate in younger people relative to their incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Age is a predictor of TWWCR independent of the other factors measured, including thickness and incidence. This may be explained by the higher number of referrals for younger patients despite the lower incidence of skin cancer in this group. This may reflect a more appropriate rate of referral in order to achieve earlier diagnosis and better outcomes.</text>

<text>Survival impact of local extension sites in surgically treated patients with temporal bone squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>115</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: Temporal bone squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is a rare malignancy. Due to its low incidence rate, studies involving TSCC treatment are limited. The aim of this study is to define the prognostic factors of surgery for TSCC by evaluating our clinical experience. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical charts of patients presenting at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 2001 and 2014 and identified 33 patients with TSCC who had been treated with surgery as initial curative treatment. RESULTS: Lateral and subtotal temporal bone resections were performed in 17 and 16 patients, respectively. The 5-year disease-specific and overall survival rate were 71 and 62%, respectively. The significant poor prognostic factors were pathological T4 (P  =  0.03), dural invasion (P  =  0.008), temporomandibular joint invasion (P  =  0.04), and a positive surgical margin (P  =  0.009). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the outcome of curative surgery for TSCC as initial treatment was favorable. However, because of the difficulty to ensure an adequate or clear surgical margin due to anatomical complexity, the surgical indication for T4 TSCC with temporomandibular joint invasion should be reconsidered.</text>

<text>Aberrant Expression Profile of Long Noncoding RNA in Human Sinonasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Microarray Analysis.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>116</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Objectives. This study aimed to identify aberrantly expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) profile of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SSCC) and explore their potential functions. Methods. We investigated lncRNA and mRNA expression in SSCC and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues obtained from 6 patients with microarrays. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and pathway analysis were utilized to investigate the gene function. Gene signal-network and lncRNA-mRNA network were depicted. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to validate 5 lncRNAs in a second set of paired SSCC and adjacent noncancerous tissues obtained from 22 additional patients. Results. We identified significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs (n = 3146) and mRNAs (n = 2208) in SSCC relative to noncancerous tissues. The GO annotation indicated that there are some core gene products that may be attributed to the progress of SSCC. The pathway analysis identified many pathways associated with cancer. The results of lncRNA-mRNA network and gene signal-network implied some core lncRNAs/mRNAs might play important roles in SSCC pathogenesis. The results of qRT-PCR showed that all of the 5 lncRNAs were differentially expressed and consistent with the microarray results. Conclusion. Our study is the first screening and analysis of lncRNAs expression profile in SSCC and may offer new insights into pathogenesis of this disease.</text>

<offset>129</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the complications, surgical site infection (SSI), and survival in salvage surgery without free-flap reconstruction for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who were treated by platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (Plat-CRT) or cetuximab-based bioradiotherapy (Cet-BRT). METHODS: Thirty-three patients treated by Plat-CRT and six treated by Cet-BRT had salvage surgery. We categorized postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification and SSI according to the wound grading scale. Overall survival calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Patients with Cet-BRT were significantly associated with the presence of SSI (P&lt;0.01) and grades IIIb-V of the Clavien-Dindo classification (P&lt;0.01) compared with those with Plat-CRT. Patients with Cet-BRT had a significantly lower overall survival than those with Plat-CRT (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that patients with Cet-BRT were significantly more associated with the presence of SSI and grades IIIb-V in the Clavien-Dindo classification than those with CRT.</text>

<text>Prognostic Relevance of Lymph Node Regression After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation for Esophageal Cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>101</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Prognostic factors after preoperative chemoradiation for patients with advanced esophageal cancer are under discussion. Treatment response measured in the primary tumor is a well-defined prognostic marker. The prognostic relevance of tumor regression in lymph nodes (LNs), eg, histomorphologic characteristics must be evaluated in a larger series of patients. From 1997-2010, 403 patients with cT3N*M0 esophageal cancer underwent preoperative chemoradiation followed by transthoracic esophagectomy. Histopathologic response of the primary tumor was graded in resected specimens as "minor" (&gt;= 10% vital residual tumor cells) or "major." The LNs of all patients without LN metastases (ypN0 n = 222, adenocarcinoma n = 129, squamous cell carcinoma n = 93) were reevaluated for central fibrosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on histomorphologic criteria of examined LNs and used to correlate these with tumor response and prognosis. The 5-year survival rate (5YSR) for all patients was 30%. Overall, 5480 LNs were reevaluated for the existence of central fibrosis in ypN0 cases. The prognostic relevance of the LN regression (LNR) grading system was confirmed for all patients with univariate (P &lt; 0.001) and multivariate (P = 0.02) analyses. In results, the 5YSR for ypN0 patients overall was 37%, for patients with major response by the primary tumor was 42%, and for minor responders was 19% (P &lt; 0.001). Analyzing LNR in major responders, the group with less than 3 LNs with central fibrosis (n = 52) showed significantly better prognosis (5YSR = 63%) compared to those with more (5YSR = 34%), (P = 0.016). Conclusion includes morphologic signs of metastatic LNR after chemoradiation, such as central fibrosis, are of prognostic relevance for patients with advanced esophageal cancer, especially for those with major response of the primary tumor.</text>

<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>111</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Objective: To explore the applicability of 2 different models of occupational health risk assessment in wooden furniture manufacturing industry. Methods: American EPA inhalation risk model and ICMM model of occupational health risk assessment were conducted to assess occupational health risk in a small wooden furniture enterprises, respectively. Results: There was poor protective measure and equipment of occupational disease in the plant. The concentration of wood dust in the air of two workshops was over occupational exposure limit (OEL) , and the CTWA was 8.9 mg/m(3) and 3.6 mg/m(3), respectively. According to EPA model, the workers who exposed to benzene in this plant had high risk (9.7*10(-6) ~34.3*10(-6)) of leukemia, and who exposed to formaldehyde had high risk (11.4 * 10(-6)) of squamous cell carcinoma. There were inconsistent evaluation results using the ICMM tools of standard-based matrix and calculated risk rating. There were very high risks to be attacked by rhinocarcinoma of the workers who exposed to wood dust for the tool of calculated risk rating, while high risk for the tool of standard-based matrix. For the workers who exposed to noise, risk of noise-induced deafness was unacceptable and medium risk using two tools, respectively. Conclusion: Both EPA model and ICMM model can appropriately predict and assessthe occupational health risk in wooden furniture manufactory, ICMM due to the relatively simple operation, easy evaluation parameters, assessment of occupational- disease-inductive factors comprehensively, and more suitable for wooden furniture production enterprise.</text>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>86</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). With microarray dataset GSE30784, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between OSCC and control samples. The DEGs overlapped with genes obtained from online database MalaCards were determined as OSCCDEG, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. A  total of 5177 up-regulated and 6081 down-regulated DEGs were identified between OSCC and control. Out of the DEGs, 451 genes were overlapped with the 704 genes gained from MalaCards and regarded as "OSCCDEG". Up-regulated OSCCDEG were associated with cell cycle pathway, while down-regulated OSCCDEG were linked to ErbB pathway. ANGPT1, ANGPT2 and 3 hub proteins (EGFR, HSP90AA1, RB1) in the PPI network were associated with the survival rates of several tumors. The largest network module with the hub protein EGFR was associated with positive regulation of cell communication. The second largest module with the hub node FN1 was related to angiogenesis. For the third network module in connection with DNA metabolism, the hub protein was PCNA. ErbB and cell cycle pathways were crucial for OSCC. EGFR, FN1, PCNA, ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 might be potential biomarkers for OSCC. These findings help provide guidelines for treating OSCC.</text>

<text>Extensive Regional Metastasis of High-Grade Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma of an Unknown Primary  Tumor.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>98</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most common salivary carcinoma. It arises most frequently in the major salivary glands but can also arise in minor glands or intraosseous sites. MEC of an unknown primary occurs very rarely. The present report documents only the third case reported in medical studies. METHODS: A 66-year-old man with previous carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the left posterior oral tongue that had been excised in 2004 and again in 2010 presented with a hard lymph node, 3 * 2  cm at level II of the right neck in July 2015. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) revealed multiple, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, with no primary site identified. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and cytologic examination from the right neck was positive for malignancy, suggestive of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Panendoscopy and biopsy revealed CIS at the tongue bases and tonsils bilaterally (p16-negative). The patient's case was presented to a tumor board, and definitive concurrent cispl.atin-based chemoradiation was recommended for TisN2cM0, stage IVA oropharyngeal CIS, which was completed in November 2015. PET-CT in January 2015 showed complex interval changes, with some areas demonstrating improvement (ie, no uptake in the left neck) and worsening in others (ie, increased metabolic activity in the right neck), suggestive of residual disease. Repeat PET-CT in March 2016 showed increased nodal involvement and increasing standardized uptake value. Bilateral modified radical neck dissection was undertaken, and histologic examination showed high-grade MEC in 51 of 61 lymph nodes with extracapsular spread and soft tissue involvement. RESULTS: The patient died in May 2016 at 2  months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic MEC of an unknown primary is a diagnostic challenge. PET-CT might not be the most reliable diagnostic investigation to identify the primary or metastatic foci, such as was demonstrated in the present case.</text>

<text>Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) is up-regulated during Barrett's carcinogenesis and predicts esophageal adenocarcinoma resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>170</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen (SCCA) is consistently overexpressed in many different solid tumors, and has been associated with both tumor aggressiveness and chemoresistance. No data, however, is currently available on SCCA expression during esophageal Barrett's carcinogenesis, nor on SCCA expression's role on esophageal adenocarcinoma chemoresistance. The SCCA immunohistochemical expression was assessed in a series of 100 biopsy samples covering the whole histological spectrum of Barrett's oncogenesis. Squamous native mucosa was characterized by a moderate to strong cytoplasmic and nuclear SCCA expression in suprabasal, medium, and superficial layers. On the other hand, almost half of the considered lesions did not express SCCA; the other half featured weak to moderate SCCA expression. The relationship between SCCA protein expression and tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was assessed in 90 esophageal adenocarcinoma specimens (40 biopsy and 50 surgery specimens), stratified according to Mandard tumor regression grade. As observed in other settings, the presence of SCCA expression clustered in the group of tumors characterized by a lower responsiveness to neoadjuvant treatments. The present results suggest an involvement of SCCA in a subset of Barrett-related tumors, and prompt to consider the SCCA-protein expression as response-predictive marker of neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal adenocarcinomas.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Introduction Dysregulation of cell cycle progression has an established link to neoplasia and cancer progression. Components of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway are frequently altered in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) by diverse mechanisms, including viral oncogene-induced degradation, mutation, deletion, and amplification. Activation of the CDK4/6 pathway may predict response to CDK4/6 inhibitors and provide clinical biomarkers. Recently, the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib showed clinical efficacy in combination with cetuximab in HNSCC patients. Areas covered This review focuses on the current research on the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, comprising preclinical animal studies through phase II clinical trials across all SCCs. Expert opinion CDK4/6 inhibitors have a proven clinical benefit in breast cancer, but data on SCCs are sparse. Although frequent dysregulation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway in SCCs suggests that targeting CDK4/6 may hold promise for improved clinical outcomes, single-agent activity has been modest in preclinical studies and absent in clinical studies. Combinations with immunotherapy or inhibitors of the PI3  K/mTOR or EGFR pathway may be effective. Given that SCCs caused by human papillomavirus have high levels of p16 and low levels of Rb, the CDK4/6 inhibitors are predicted to be ineffective in these cancers.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) are a new class of drugs which affect the activity of HDACs resulting in changed of acetylation in many proteins. HDIs can induce differentiation, cell growth arrest, apoptosis, inhibit proliferation and angiogenesis in cancer, whereas normal cells are comparatively resistant to the action of HDIs. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effect of a well-known cytostatic agent-cisplatin (CDDP) and a histone deacetylase inhibitors-either suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, vorinostat) or valproic acid (VPA), on the proliferation of lung cancer cells, as well as induction of apoptosis and inhibition of the cell cycle progression. The anti-proliferative activity of VPA or SAHA used alone, or in combination with CDDP were determined by means of MTT test. The type of pharmacologic interactions between HDAC inhibitors and CDDP was assessed using isobolographic analysis. We observed additive interactions for the CCDP with SAHA, as well as for the CDDP with VPA combinations with respect to their anti-proliferative effects on three different lung cancer cell lines (A549, NCI-H1563 and NCI-H2170). Such additive effects were observed regardless of the histologic type (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) and sensitivity for the drugs applied. Combination treatment also augmented the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle perturbation mediated by CDDP alone, thereby enhancing anti-cancer effect of tested drugs. In conclusion, the combined therapy of HDIs and CDDP may be a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of lung cancer.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most prevalent type of esophageal cancer and accumulating evidence has confirmed the role of miRNAs in ESCC. One such miRNA, miR-370, was found to be aberrantly downregulated in various human malignancies. This study showed that the expression of miR-370 was significantly lower in ESCC tissues and cell lines, and miR-370 functioned as a tumor suppressor in ESCC. Moreover, this is the first report that showed miR-370 suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth by directly targeting Pim family kinases 1 (PIM1). Furthermore, alpinumisoflavone, a naturally occurring flavonoid, could inhibit tumor growth of ESCC by targeting miR-370/PIM1 signaling.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Loss-of-function mutations in SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling subunit genes are observed in many cancers, but an oncogenic role for SWI/SNF is not well established. Here, we reveal that ACTL6A, encoding an SWI/SNF subunit linked to stem cell and progenitor cell function, is frequently co-amplified and highly expressed together with the p53 family member p63 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). ACTL6A and p63 physically interact, cooperatively controlling a transcriptional program that promotes proliferation and suppresses differentiation, in part through activation of the Hippo-YAP pathway via regulators including WWC1. Ectopic ACTL6A/p63 expression promotes tumorigenesis, while ACTL6A expression and YAP activation are highly correlated in primary HNSCC and predict poor patient survival. Thus, ACTL6A and p63 collaborate as oncogenic drivers in HNSCC.</text>

<text>Surgery for malignant pulmonary nodules in patients with a history of oesophageal cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>89</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to analyse the short- and long-term results of surgery for malignant pulmonary nodules in patients with a history of oesophageal cancer (EC) in order to assess the significance of surgery in these patients. METHODS: The data of 28 consecutive patients with a history of EC who underwent pulmonary resection for malignant pulmonary nodules were reviewed. The perioperative and long-term results were analysed. RESULTS: The histological type of oesophageal cancer was squamous cell carcinoma in all of the patients. The preceding treatments for EC were surgery with or without neoadjuvant therapy in 21, chemoradiotherapy in 4 and endoscopic resection in 3. The patients were smokers, with low body mass indices, and had high incidences of a history of malignancy besides EC and other comorbidities. Complete resection was achieved in 27 patients (96%). There was no perioperative mortality and 7 patients (25%) developed postoperative complications. Based on the pathological and clinical criteria, 14 patients (50%) were diagnosed with primary lung cancer, 10 patients (35%) with pulmonary metastases from EC and 4 patients (25%) with pulmonary metastasis from another cancer. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates of all patients were 48% and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for malignant pulmonary nodules in patients with a history of EC can be performed with acceptable surgical risk despite the high rate of comorbid illness in these patients. Proactive surgical management should be considered for treating malignant pulmonary nodules in patients with a previous history of EC as this strategy provides favourable long-term results.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Vulvar cancer is a rare malignancy with high curability in early-stage disease, yet poor outcomes for advanced-stage and recurrent disease. Surgical management is at the cornerstone of treatment for most vulvar cancers, and includes conservative and radical resection of the primary vulvar tumor and excision of local lymph nodes, which are major prognostic factors and drive adjuvant treatment. This review summarizes the surgical management of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, specifically initial treatment guidelines by stage, based on the 2017 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Vulvar Cancer.</text>

<offset>244</offset>
<text>AIM: To compare quality of life (QOL) between standard (SFX) chemoradiotherapy (arm A) and altered fractionation radiotherapy (AFX) with panitumumab (PMab; arm B). METHODS: Patients with T any N  +  M0 or T3-4N0M0 squamous cell head-neck carcinoma were randomised to SFX (70  Gy/35/7  wks) plus cisplatin (100  mg/m(2) IV  *  3) versus AFX (70  Gy/35/6  wks) plus PMab (9  mg/kg IV  *  3). QOL was collected at baseline, end of radiation therapy (RT) and 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post-RT using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head and Neck (FACT-H_N), MD Anderson Dysphagia Index (MDADI) and SWAL-QOL. We hypothesised a 6-point  more favourable change in FACT-H_N score from baseline to 1 year in arm B over arm A. RESULTS: Among 320 patients, median follow-up was 46 (range: 0.1-64.3) months, median age 56, 84% male, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 0 (71%), 1 (29%). Primary site was oropharynx in 81% (p16+ 68%, p16- 16%, missing 16%). Baseline scores did not differ by arm (A/B): FACT-H_N 116.5/115, MDADI Global 83/77, SWAL-QOL General 67/68. At 1 year, no difference was seen between arms in FACT-H_N change from baseline: A -1.70, B -4.81, p  =  0.194. Subscale change scores by arm were (A/B): last week RT, FACT-Physical (-11.6, -10, p  =  0.049), MDADI Physical (-40.4, -33.9, p  =  0.045), and SWAL-QOL Eating Duration (-61.2, -51.2, p  =  0.02), Eating Desire (-53.3, -43.9, p  =  0.031) and Mental Health (-42, -32.6, p  =  0.009); 4 months, HN subscale (-7.7, -10, p  =  0.014). No clinically important differences by arm were seen post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PMab with AFX did not durably improve QOL or swallowing as compared with SFX with cisplatin.

<text>UNASSIGNED: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) is a potent immune-tolerant molecule and has a critical role in various pathological conditions of cancer. The aim of the study was to analyze the association of HLA-G polymorphism as a risk factor in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). The HLA-G polymorphism at 3'UTR 14bp INDEL (rs371194629) and +3142G/C (rs1063320) were studied in 383 HNSCC patients and 383 ethnically similar-aged healthy controls in North Indian population. The genotyping study of two polymorphisms of HLA-G was documented using DNA-PAGE and RFLP-PCR method. 14bp INDEL Del/Ins, Ins/Ins genotype and Ins allele were more pronounced in HNSCC patients in compared to controls. Whereas, +3142 C/C genotype and C allele were associated with risk factors in HNSCC. Furthermore, the dual effect of polymorphisms; both variants (Del/Ins-Ins/Ins _ G/C-C/C) carrying loci was significantly (OR=2.78) associated with the disease compared to one variant (Del/Del-G/C or Del/Del-C/C or Ins/Ins-G/G). Moreover, both polymorphisms showed promising link in terms of tobacco influence on HNSCC risk. It can be concluded that this study first time reports that C/C, Del/Ins and Ins/Ins genotype as well as C and Ins allele could be major risk factors with strong impact of tobacco for HNSCC in North Indian population.</text>

<text>Pure but Not Mixed Histologic Variants Are Associated With Poor Survival at Radical Cystectomy in Bladder Cancer Patients.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>122</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of pure and mixed histologic variant versus pure urothelial carcinoma in nonmetastatic bladder cancer (BCa) patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated data from 1067 patients treated with RC and pelvic lymph node dissection between 1990 and 2013 at a single institution tertiary-care referral center. All specimens were evaluated by dedicated uropathologists. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the impact of the presence of pure and mixed histologic variants versus pure urothelial on recurrence, cancer-specific mortality, and overall mortality after accounting for all available confounders. RESULTS: In total, 201 (19%) and 137 (13%) patients were found with mixed and pure variants at RC, respectively. Mixed preponderant variants were sarcomatoid, lymphoepitelial, squamous, and glandular; small-cell and micropapillary variants were found mostly as pure variants. With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, patients who harbored pure variant were found by multivariable analyses to have lower survival outcomes compared to pure urothelial carcinoma (all P  &lt; .01). Conversely, no differences were found between mixed variant versus pure urothelial by multivariable Cox regression analyses predicting recurrence, cancer-specific mortality, and overall mortality (all P  &gt;  .1). CONCLUSION: The presence of histologic variants at RC is a common finding, accounting for approximately 30% of specimens. In this setting, the presence of a pure variant but not the presence of mixed variant with urothelial carcinoma is related to a detrimental effect on survival outcomes after RC.</text>

<text>Validation of housekeeping genes for the normalization of RT-qPCR expression studies in oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line treated by 5 kinds of chemotherapy drugs.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>168</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has become a frequently used strategy in gene expression studies. The relative quantification method is an important and commonly used method for the evaluation of RT-qPCR data. The key of this method is to identify an applicable internal control gene because the usage of different internal control genes may lead to distinct conclusions. Herein, we report the validation of 12 common housekeeping genes for RT-qPCR for gene expression analysis in the Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line (KB and Tca-8113) treated by 5 kinds of Chemotherapy Drugs. The gene expression stability and applicability of the 12 housekeeping gene candidates were determined using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software programs. Comprehensive analyzing the results of the three software, ALAS1/GAPDH, ALAS1 and GUSB were suggested to be the most stable candidate genes for the study of both KB and Tca-8113 cell line together, KB cell line, and Tca-8113 cell line, respectively. This study provides useful information to normalize gene expression accurately for the investigation of target gene profiling in cell lines of OSCC. Further clarification of tumor molecular expression markers with our recommended housekeeping genes may improve the accuracy of diagnosis and estimation of prognostic factors as well as provide novel personalized treatments for OSCC patients.</text>

<text>PURPOSE: The tumor suppressor protein p53 is known to control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Lupeol is a phytochemical that has been found to induce apoptosis in different cancer types through the extrinsic pathway. As yet, however, its role in the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway in head and neck cancer has not been investigated. Here, we aimed at understanding the mechanism underlying the antitumor effect of Lupeol in head and neck cancer. METHODS: The antitumor effect of Lupeol on oral and laryngeal carcinomas was assessed using two in vitro 2D cell line models (HEp-2, UPCI:SCC-131) and, subsequently, an ex vivo 3D tumor explant culture platform that maintains key features of the native tumor microenvironment. The mechanism underlying Lupeol-mediated antitumor responses was delineated using MTT, colony formation, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry assays. RESULTS: We found that Lupeol induced an enhanced expression of p53 in both cell line models tested and, subsequently, cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. In addition we found that, following Lupeol treatment, p53 induced Bax expression and activated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (as measured by Caspase-3 cleavage). Interestingly, Lupeol was also found to trigger G1 cell cycle arrest through up-regulation of the expression of CDKN2A, but not p21, resulting in inhibition of CyclinD1. In an ex vivo platform Lupeol was found to impart a potent antitumor response as defined by inhibition of Ki67 expression, decreased cell viability and concomitant activation (cleavage) of Caspase-3. Finally, we found that Lupeol can re-sensitize primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor samples that had clinically progressed under a Cisplatin treatment regimen. CONCLUSION: Together, our data indicate that Lupeol may orchestrate a bifurcated regulation of neoplastic growth and apoptosis in head and neck cancers and may serve as a promising agent for the management of tumors that have progressed on a platinum-based treatment regimen.</text>

<text>PURPOSE: Previously, the engulfment and cell motility 3 (ELMO3)  protein has been reported to be involved in cell migration and cytoskeletal remodeling. As of yet, nothing is known about the role of ELMO3 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The purpose of this study was to asses ELMO3 expression in postoperatively irradiated HNSCC patients and to evaluate a possible correlation between this expression and patient survival. METHODS: 125 postoperatively irradiated HNSCC patients were included in this study. ELMO3 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of ELMO3 in the respective HNSCC tumor tissues and its lymph node metastases was correlated with patient survival using Kaplan-Meier curve analyses. RESULTS: Through IHC, ELMO3 expression was detected in 71.2% of the HNSCC cases tested. We found significantly increased overall and disease-free survival rates and decreased recurrence rates in patients with no detectable ELMO3 expression. In reverse, we found that ELMO3 expression served as an independent marker for a decreased overall and disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that in the surgically treated and postoperatively irradiated patients tested, ELMO3 expression serves as a predictive marker for reduced survival.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Despite progress in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in recent decades, including new surgical techniques, radiotherapy advances and chemotherapy schedules, the prognosis for the affected patients has not improved at the same pace, and still, most HNSCC patients are diagnosed in advanced stages. To increase their survival, the development of better screening methods for early detection is required and appropriate tailored therapeutic interventions are desired. The aim of the present study was to evaluate miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers in patients undergoing organ preservation protocol for locally advanced HNSCC. For this purpose, we assessed the global miRNA expression profile of 15 HNSCC patients ('screening set') to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in responders and non-responders to therapy. Four miRNAs differentially expressed in HNSCC samples from the 'screening set' were validated in a different cohort of patients (47 samples - 'validation set'). The results from the 'validation set' showed that the higher expression of one of these miRNAs, miR-21, was negatively associated with the treatment response to the organ preservation protocol (p=0.029). A multivariate analysis showed that, in a model adjusted for age, tumor site, p16 immunoexpression and tumor resectability, high expression of miR-21 remained an independent predictor of poor response to the organ preservation protocol (OR=5.69; 95%CI 1.27-25.58; p=0.023), together with clinical stage IV (OR=5.05; 95%CI 1.22-20.88; p=0.025). Furthermore, considering the entire cohort, patients with high expression of miR-21 had worse survival. A multivariate Cox regression analysis also showed miR-21 (HR=2.05; 95%CI 1.05-4.02; p=0.036) and clinical stage IV (HR=3.17; 95%CI 1.49-6.77; p=0.003) as independent prognostic factors (model adjusted for age, tumor site, tumor resectability, and sets 'screening' or 'validation').In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the evaluation of miR-21 expression could be an important tool for treatment planning and a prognosis predictior for HNSCC patients undergoing organ preservation protocols.</text>

<text>The role of long non-coding RNAs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: As systemic review.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>81</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Recent development of cutting edge research found that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays important roles in carcinogenesis and progression. In Southeast Asia and North Africa, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most common aggressive squamous cell carcinoma. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is most frequently occurring in males. However, nasopharyngeal carcinoma is caused by a combination of several factors as viral, environmental factors, and heredity. Till now, the potential pathway or mechanism of NPC is not well known. In our present review, we strongly emphasized on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and its significant role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. It has been showed that lncRNAs regulate the development and progression of different types of cancers, including NPC. In addition, it has been found that chromatin organization, transcriptional and post-transcriptional events are regulated by lncRNAs. Our present review summarizes the roles of lncRNAs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and provides an overview of the feasibility of lncRNAs as diagnosis, prognosis and potential treatment for NPC patients.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with the tumorigenesis of human cancers. However, the relevance of lncRNAs in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is still unclear. To discover novel TSCC-related lncRNAs, we analyzed the lncRNA expression patterns in two sets of TSCC gene expression profile data, and found that long intergenic non-coding RNA 673 (LINC00673) was significantly upregulated in TSCC samples. Then we examined LINC00673 expression in 202 TSCC tissue specimens, LINC00673 is highly expressed in a significant proportion of human TSCC biopsies and correlates with poor prognosis. Knockdown LINC00673 significantly inhibited the cell invasion and migration capability in TSCC cells. Our findings suggest that LINC00673 may play an essential role in TSCC progression and might serve as a potential biomarker for early detection and prognosis prediction of TSCC.</text>

<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>90</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: This study characterized the infiltration of primary tumors along the muscles, fascia and spaces of the maxillofacial region in buccal squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC) and suggested a new surgical strategy that is suitable for most stages. Based on the anatomic characteristics and infiltration of the primary tumor a new surgical approach - unit resection buccal surgery (URBS) - was developed. We evaluated this new surgical strategy, across a cohort of 127 BSCCs: 60 cases treated with URBS and 67 cases treated with conventional surgery. Notably there was no statistical difference in the clinicopathological variables between the two groups. After initial treatment with curative intent, the patients were regularly followed-up with clinical examination and imaging. URBS proved suitable for almost all stages of BSCC, and was particularly advantageous for advanced stages of BSCC. At 2 years post-treatment, the rates of overall survival were 83.3% in the URBS group and 60.1% in the conventional surgery group, respectively (hazard ratio 0.38; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.75; P=0.005). Similarly, the rates of disease-free survival were 76.6% and 51.9% in the URBS group and the conventional surgery group, respectively (hazard ratio 0.42; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.75; P=0.003). The principles of URBS are suitable for almost all stages of BSCC, especially advanced stages. URBS may improve the prognosis of BSCC patients.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Nuclear factor-kappa B1 (NF-        B1) is a pleiotropic transcription factor and key contributor to tumorigenesis in many types of cancer. Numerous studies have addressed the association of a functional insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism (-94ins/delATTG, rs28362491) in the promoter region of NFKB1 gene with the risk of various types of cancer; however, their conclusions have been inconsistent. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to reevaluate this association. PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), and WANFANG databases were searched through July 2016 to retrieve relevant studies. After careful assessment, 50 case-control studies, comprising 18,299 cases and 23,484 controls were selected. Crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to determine the strength of the association. The NFKB1 -94ins/delATTG polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk of overall cancer in the homozygote model (DD vs. II): OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.64-0.87); heterozygote model (ID vs. II): OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.83-0.99; recessive model (DD vs. ID/II): OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.71-0.91; dominant model (ID/DD vs. II): OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.78-0.95; and allele contrast model (D vs. I): OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.81-0.95). Subgroup and stratified analyses revealed decreased risks for lung cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and oral squamous cell carcinoma, and this association held true also for Asians (especially Chinese subjects) in hospital-based studies, and in studies with quality scores less than nine. Well-designed, large-scale case-control studies are needed to confirm these results.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Accumulating evidence has shown that PD-L1 expression is associated with clinicopathological features in various human malignancies. We searched for correlations between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological data in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients. PD-L1 expression in primary tumors from 278 patients was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in ESCC tissue microarray. Survival curves were constructed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were performed to identify associations with outcome variables. Overall, tumoral PD-L1 expression (&gt;= 10%, 20% or 30% as cut-off value) was associated with favorable DFS and OS upon multivariate analysis. When the patients stratified into stage I-II (168, 60.4%) and stage III-IV (110, 39.6%), or with lymph node metastasis (133, 47.8%), the prognostic role was not consistent. In patients with stage I-II disease, tumoral PD-L1 expression (&gt;= 5%, 10%, 20% or 30%) was associated with better DFS and OS upon multivariate analysis. In patients without lymph node metastasis, tumoral PD-L1 expression (&gt;= 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, or 30%) was associated with improved DFS and OS in univariate or multivariate analysis. However, PD-L1 expression was not correlated with prognosis in patients with stage III-IV disease or with lymph node metastasis. Our results for the first time showed the prognostic role of tumoral PD-L1 expression was variable in different stages and lymph node status of ESCC. Tumoral PD-L1 expression was independent favorable predictor in ESCC patients with Stage I-II disease or without lymph node metastasis, not in stage III-IV or lymph node metastasis.</text>

<text>Histologic characteristics of thymic adenocarcinomas: Clinicopathologic study of a nine-case series and a review of the literature.</text>

<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>131</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Primary thymic adenocarcinoma is an extraordinarily rare malignancy; only 49 cases have been reported in the medical literature to date. Because of its rarity, clinical and pathologic characteristics of thymic adenocarcinoma are unclear. We present nine cases of primary thymic adenocarcinoma and discuss clinicopathologic findings in the context of the existing literature. Two-hundred twenty-six thymic carcinoma cases were diagnosed at Samsung Medical Center in Korea, from January, 2001 to July, 2016. Nine of these 226 cases were primary thymic adenocarcinomas. The mean age of primary thymic adenocarcinoma patients was 53.6 years, slightly younger than the mean age of patients with thymic squamous cell carcinomas. The male to female ratio was 2:1. Symptoms, if present, were usually due to compression by the tumor. Tumors showed an extra- or intra-cellular mucin and tubular growth pattern, with CK20- and CDX2-immunoreactivity, similar to adenocarcinomas of the lower intestinal tract. Twenty-five previously reported cases, classified as mucinous adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, also had similar characteristics to enteric-type adenocarcinoma and generally expressed CK20, CDX2, CEA, and/or MUC2. Some of these cases had a thymic cyst. These characteristics are different from those of papillary thymic carcinomas, which are morphologically similar to papillary thyroid carcinomas, express CK7 but not CK20, and are often associated with thymoma. The prognosis of thymic adenocarcinoma, enteric type appeared to be worse than the prognosis of papillary thymic carcinoma or carcinoma with adenoid cystic carcinoma-like features. In summary, we demonstrated that common primary thymic adenocarcinomas show enteric-type differentiation with mucin. This tumor type has distinct clinical, pathological, immunohistochemical and prognostic characteristics and is different from other subtypes of thymic adenocarcinoma, papillary thymic carcinoma, and carcinoma with adenoid cystic carcinoma-like features.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The chromatin remodeling switch sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) complex has been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis and dedifferentiation of neoplasms from several organs with prognostic and potential therapeutic implications. We herein investigated the expression of the SWI/SNF complex catalytic subunits SMARCA4 (BRG1) and SMARCA2 (BRM) in 316 consecutive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens on tissue microarrays (171 adenocarcinomas [ADCAs], 130 squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs], 9 adenosquamous carcinomas, and 6 large cell carcinomas) excluding undifferentiated/giant cell or rhabdoid carcinomas. Complete loss of SMARCA4 was observed in 8 (5.5%) of 146 evaluable pulmonary ADCAs and 6 (5.2%) of 115 evaluable pulmonary SCCs, whereas 9 (6.4%) of 140 ADCAs and 2 (1.7%) of 117 SCCs showed SMARCA2 loss. Two of 6 large cell carcinomas were SMARCA2 deficient. Concurrent loss of both markers was observed in 4 cases (2 ADCAs and 2 SCCs). Of 15 ADCAs with loss of either or both markers, 12 (80%) were TTF1 negative. In conclusion, SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 deficiency is observed in 5.1% and 4.8% of NSCLC, respectively. SMARCB1 expression was intact in all cases. The presence of differentiated histology (glandular or squamous) is a novel aspect among SWI/SNF-deficient carcinomas which in other organs generally are associated with undifferentiated/rhabdoid morphology. The predominance of TTF1 negativity among SWI/SNF-deficient pulmonary ADCA (80%) underlines the need to include these 2 markers in the evaluation of TTF1-negative ADCA of putative pulmonary origin. Given the recently documented potential of SMARCA4 loss as a predictor of chemosensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy in NSCLC, recognition of the clinicopathological features of SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC in routine surgical pathology practice is recommended.</text>

<text>Gene expression changes in tumor free tongue tissue adjacent to tongue squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>95</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Due to the high frequency of loco-regional recurrences, which could be explained by changes in the field surrounding the tumor, patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck show poor survival. Here we identified a total of 554 genes as dysregulated in clinically tumor free tongue tissue in patients with tongue tumors when compared to healthy control tongue tissue. Among the top dysregulated genes when comparing control and tumor free tissue were those involved in apoptosis (CIDEC, MUC1, ZBTB16, PRNP, ECT2), immune response (IFI27) and differentiation (KRT36). Data suggest that these are important findings which can aid in earlier diagnosis of tumor development, a relapse or a novel squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, in the absence of histological signs of a tumor.</text>

<text>Prognostic impact of immune microenvironment in laryngeal and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: Immune cell subtypes, immuno-suppressive pathways and clinicopathologic characteristics.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Immune system affects prognosis of various malignancies. Anti-immune pathways like PD-L1 and CTLA4 are used by the tumor to overcome immune system and they serve as immunotherapy targets. The immune microenvironment of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCHN) has not been sufficiently studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 152 SCCHN were immunohistochemically studied for the expression of CD3, CD8, CD57, CD4, granzyme b, CD20, CD163, S100, PD-L1, CTLA4 and CXCR4. RESULTS: CD3, CD8, CD57 and stromal S100 higher density is a good prognostic factor (p=0.02, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 respectively). CTLA4 tumor expression is a poor prognostic factor (p=0.05). The rest immune cells do not affect prognosis. CD3 and CD8 density does not correlate with clinicopathological factors or p16/p53 expression, while CD57 and CD4 higher density is associated with the absence of distant metastases (p=0.03 and 0.07, respectively). Higher CD20 and S100 density is associated with lower T stage (p=0.04 and 0.03, respectively). PD-L1 expression is higher in CD3, CD8, and CD163 infiltrated tumors and in histologically more aggressive tumors. Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is better in highly CD3 infiltrated tumors and in tumors with less intraepithelial macrophages. CONCLUSION: Rich T-lympocytic and dendritic cell response is a good prognostic factor in SCCHN, whereas tumors expressing CTLA4 show poor prognosis. PDL1 expression does not affect prognosis, but it is expressed in histologically more aggressive tumors and in T-cells rich tumors. Response to induction chemotherapy is better in tumors less infiltrated by macrophages and mostly infiltrated by T cells.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well-validated oncological target molecule for monoclonal antibody therapies and Sym004 is a novel anti-EGFR antibody mixture comprising two recombinant chimeric IgG1 antibodies against non-overlapping epitopes of EGFR. Because EGFR is highly expressed in the majority of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs), we investigated the efficacy of Sym004 in human ESCC cell lines. Forty eight ESCC cell lines were treated with three kinds of anti-EGFR antibodies (Sym004, cetuximab, and panitumumab). Genetic background was investigated by next generation sequencing. The internalization of anti-EGFR antibodies into ESCC cells and inhibition of the EGFR signaling cascade by anti-EGFR antibodies were investigated in vitro. Furthermore, growth inhibition by anti-EGFR antibody treatment was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Sym004 treatments were more effective at inducing EGFR internalization and degradation than the two other anti-EGFR antibodies. Sym004 was more sensitive significantly to cell lines with EGFR gene amplification than those without amplification (P = 0.002). Growth inhibition of Sym004 was greater than in that of cetuximab or panitumumab in vitro and in vivo. These studies showed that Sym004 exhibited antitumor activity in some ESCC cell lines in preclinical settings and warrant a clinical evaluation in patients with ESCC. EGFR amplification is a potential biomarker of response to Sym004.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The semaphorins and the plexins are a family of large, cysteine-rich proteins originally identified as regulators of axon growth and lymphocyte activation that are now known to provide motility and positional information for a number of cell and tissue types. For example, our group and others have shown that some malignancies over express Semaphorin 4D (S4D), which acts through its receptor Plexin-B1 (PB1) on endothelial cells to attract blood vessels from the surrounding stroma for the purpose of supporting tumor growth. While plexins are the known functional receptors for the semaphorins, there is evidence that transmembrane semaphorins may transmit a signal themselves through their short cytoplasmic tail, a phenomenon known as 'reverse signaling.' We used computational methods based upon correlated evolution of sequences of interacting proteins, mutational analysis and in vitro and in vivo measurements of tumor aggressiveness to show that when bound to PB1, transmembrane S4D associates with the Rac GTPase exchange factor T lymphoma invasion and metastasis (Tiam) 1, which activates Rac and promotes proliferation, invasion and metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. These results suggest that not only can S4D production by tumor cells affect the microenvironment, but engagement of this semaphorin at the cell surface activates a reverse signaling mechanism that influences tumor aggressiveness in OSCC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Host immunogenetic background plays an important role in human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer development. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 3 (ITPR3) is essential for both immune activation and cancer pathogenesis. We aim to investigate if ITPR3 genetic polymorphisms are associated with the risk of cervical cancer in Taiwanese women. ITPR3 rs3748079 A/G and rs2229634 C/T polymorphisms were genotyped in a hospital-based study of 462 women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and 921 age-matched healthy control women. The presence and genotypes of HPV in CSCC was determined. No significant association of individual ITPR3 variants were found among controls, CSCC, and HPV-16 positive CSCC. However, we found a significant association of haplotype AT between CSCC and controls (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.31-3.97, P = 2.83 * 10-3) and the OR increased further in CSCC patients infected with HPV-16 (OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.55-5.37, P = 4.54 * 10-4). The linkage disequilibrium analysis demonstrated that ITPR3 association with CSCC was independent of HLA-DRB1 alleles. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AT haplotype in the ITPR3 gene may serve as a potential marker for genetic susceptibility to CSCC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Tumor invasion and metastasis is responsible for the poor prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC); therefore, exploring the mechanisms by which malignant cells disseminate, spread and flourish in secondary sites, as well as translating the bench results to clinical practice are in urgent need. Previous reports showed that integrin a6 increases in ESCC specimens and its dysregulated spatial localization correlates positively with the unfavorable outcome of ESCC patients. Here, we clarify that integrin a6 promotes invasion and metastasis of ESCC cells In vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, decreased integrin a6 attenuates motility of malignant cells partially through deactivating Akt pathway, which is essential for ESCC cells motility. Moreover, integrin a6 serves as a genuine target of miR-92b in suppressing ESCC motility. Our results for the first time describe that miR-92b/integrin a6/Akt axis controls the motility of ESCC, thereby providing a promising diagnosis or therapeutic option.</text>

<text>Bile acids: a potential role in the pathogenesis of pharyngeal malignancy.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>74</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is thought to be a risk factor for head and neck malignancies. Bile acids are one of the principle components of gastric refluxate and have previously been implicated in the development of oesophageal and bowel malignancies. There is clear evidence that bile acids reflux into the laryngopharynx. Despite this, the carcinogenic properties of bile acids in this area are yet to be fully identified. We therefore investigated the potential role of bile acids in pharyngeal malignancy, through the highly conserved process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT occurs in invasion and metastasis and is a central process in the development of epithelial carcinoma. DESIGN: TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH STUDY: METHODS: Human hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma FaDu cells were challenged with primary (cholic or chenodeoxycholic) and secondary (deoxycholic or lithocholic) bile acids. EMT relevant proteins TGF-b1 and MMP-9 were measured in the cell culture supernates at 48-hours via ELISA. Cell viability was confirmed &gt;95% via CellTiter-Blue assay. RESULTS: Significantly greater concentrations of TGF-b1 were measured in the culture supernates of cells treated with cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid. MMP-9 levels were increased in deoxycholic acid and lithocolic acid stimulations when compared to control (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration that bile acids induce TGF-b1 and MMP-9 in pharyngeal cells. TGF-b1 is considered a master switch for EMT while MMP-9 is a part of the EMT proteome which degrades basement membranes. This implies a potential role for bile acids in pharyngeal carcinogenesis through the mechanism of EMT and suggests potential novel therapeutic targets. This article is protected by copyright.

<offset>111</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Aim of the study was to assess the role of angiogenesis in the process of malignant transformation of clinical diagnosed oral leukoplakia (OL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 131 histological preparations (oral leukoplakia/hyperkeratosis without dysplasia (OL; n=49), oral leukoplakia/hyperkeratosis with mild dysplasia (OL-SIN1; n=33), with moderate dysplasia (OL-SIN2; n=13) and leukoplakia-derived oral squamous cell carcinoma (OL-OSCC; n=36)) were evaluated for microvessel density (MVD), vessel diameter as well as for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) expression. Data were compared within the groups. RESULTS: For MVD, there were significant differences between OL and OL-SIN 2/OL-OSCC (P &lt; 0.05) and between OL-SIN 1 and OL-OSCC (P &lt; 0.05). For OL-OSCC, vessel diameters were significantly increased compared to OL (P &lt; 0.05). Expression of VEGF-A increased significantly gradually from OL-SIN 1 to OSCC (each P &lt; 0.05). This was especially evident for lesions of the tongue when compared to the others. CONCLUSION: Angiogenesis increases during the transition from OL through dysplasia to OL-OSCC. Especially in OL-OSCCs of the tongue, VEGF-A-expression may be used for estimation of malignant progression of OL. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to validate in vitro drug sensitivity testing of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines in an in vivo xenograft model and to identify treatment-induced changes in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway that could be used as markers for cetuximab treatment response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro and in vivo cetuximab sensitivity of two HNSCC cell lines, UT-SCC-14 and UT-SCC-45, was assessed using a crystal violet assay and xenografts in nude mice, respectively. The expression of EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), phosphorylated Src (pSrc), and Ki-67 were investigated by immunohistochemistry. To verify these results the in vitro expression of EGFR and pEGFR were analyzed with ELISA in a panel of 10 HNSCC cell lines. RESULTS: A close correlation was found between in vitro and in vivo cetuximab sensitivity data in the two investigated HNSCC cell lines. In treatment sensitive UT-SCC-14 xenografts there was a decrease in EGFR, pEGFR, and pSrc upon cetuximab treatment. Interestingly, in insensitive UT-SCC-45 xenografts an increased expression of these three proteins was found. The change in EGFR and pEGFR expression in vivo was confirmed in cetuximab sensitive and insensitive HNSCC cell lines using ELISA. CONCLUSION: High sensitivity to cetuximab was strongly associated with a treatment-induced reduction in pEGFR both in vivo and in vitro in a panel of HNSCC cell lines, suggesting that EGFR and pEGFR dynamics could be used as a predictive biomarker for cetuximab treatment response.

<text>A novel serum microRNA signature to screen esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>78</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been used as promising diagnostic biomarkers for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We performed miRNA expression profiling using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) based Exiqon panels from three ESCC pools and one normal control (NC) pool samples. Using qRT-PCR, identified serum miRNAs were further confirmed in training (32 ESCC vs. 32 NCs) and testing stages (108 ESCC vs. 96 NCs). Consequently, five serum miRNAs (miR-20b-5p, miR-28-3p, miR-192-5p, miR-223-3p, and miR-296-5p) were significantly overexpressed in ESCC compared with NCs. The diagnostic value of the 5-miRNA signature was validated by an external cohort (60 ESCC vs. 60 NCs). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the 5-miRNA signature were 0.753, 0.763, and 0.966 for the training, testing, and the external validation stages, respectively. The expression levels of the miRNAs were also determined in tissues, arterial serum, and exosomes. MiR-20b-5p, miR-28-3p, and miR-192-5p were significantly upregulated in ESCC tissues, while miR-296-5p was overexpressed in ESCC serum exosomes. In conclusion, we identified a 5-miRNA signature in serum for the detection of ESCC.</text>

<text>Human Papillomavirus-related Carcinoma with Adenoid Cystic-like Features of the Sinonasal Tract: Clinical and Morphological Characterization of 6 New Cases.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>156</offset>
<text>AIMS: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is known as causative for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx, but is also not infrequently found in carcinomas of the sinonasal tract. Recently, a subset of these carcinomas was recognized to harbour HPV33 and have a significant morphological overlap with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), a rare and aggressive carcinoma originating in the minor salivary glands. Termed HPV-related carcinoma with ACC-like features, only 9 cases have been reported. To clarify the occurrence of these tumours we screened a large material for presence of HPV-related ACC-like carcinoma. The identified tumours were characterized immunohistochemically and with fluorescence in situ hybridization and clinicopathologic information for all cases is presented. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-seven candidate cases were screened for presence of HPV. Six cases were identified and genotyped as HPV types 33, 35 and 56. All six cases had areas of dysplastic mucosal lining and showed remarkable heterogeneous morphologies. MYB, MYBL1, and NFIB genes were intact and, interestingly, staining for MYB protein was largely negative in contrast to what was found in ACC. One patient experienced a local recurrence 11 years after initial treatment and the remaining five patients were alive without evidence of disease. CONCLUSION: We report six new cases of HPV-related ACC-like carcinoma and found that, although in a small material, the prognosis for these patients seems more favourable than for ACC. For the distinction between ACC and HPV-related ACC-like carcinoma, p16, MYB immunohistochemistry, or investigation of MYB, MYBL1, and NFIB gene status are valuable.

<text>UNASSIGNED: Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common cancer in the oral cavity. We previously demonstrated that transforming growth factor-b1  (TGF-b1) promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition  (EMT) of human oral squamous cell carcinoma  (hOSCC)  cells; however, it remains to be clarified whether the TGF-b superfamily member bone morphogenetic protein  (BMP) affects this process in hOSCC cells. Here, we examined the independent and collective effects of TGF-b1 and BMP-2 on EMT and mesenchymal  -epithelial transition  (MET) in a panel of four hOSCC cell lines. Notably, we found that HSC-4 cells were the most responsive to BMP-2 stimulation, which resulted in the upregulation of Smad1/5/9 target genes such as the MET  inducers  ID1 and cytokeratin  9 (CK9). Furthermore, BMP-2 downregulated the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and the EMT inducer Snail, but upregulated epithelial CK9 expression, indicating that BMP-2 prefers to induce MET rather than EMT. Moreover, TGF-b1 dampened BMP-2-induced epithelial gene expression by inhibiting Smad1/5/9 expression and phosphorylation. Functional analysis revealed that TGF-b1 and BMP-2 significantly enhanced HSC-4 cell migration and proliferation, respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that TGF-b positively regulates hOSCC invasion in the primary tumor, whereas BMP-2 facilitates cancer cell colonization at secondary metastatic sites. Thus, the invasive and metastatic characteristics of hOSCC appear to be reciprocally regulated by BMP and TGF-b.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: CD44 is a marker of cancer stem cells in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and CD44 expression is related to prognosis in cancer patients. We examined whether herbal medicine components affect CD44 expression and induce cancer cell apoptosis. Baicalin enhanced apoptosis with no effect on CD44 levels, while baicalein did not enhance apoptosis and upregulated CD44 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, baicalein induced phosphorylation of CHK1, as a marker of DNA damage response to S-to-G2/M phase arrest. Our results clearly demonstrated that baicalein enhanced expression of CD44 and accordingly enhanced the DNA damage response. These data suggest that induction of CD44 inhibited cancer cell induction of apoptosis by increasing the DNA damage response. Together, our findings suggest that CD44 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma plays a role in enhancing the DNA damage response.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of Annexin  A1  (ANXA1) on the proliferation, migration and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  (ESCC) cells and its possible mechanisms of action. After constructing the ANXA1 overexpression plasmid, we transfected this plasmid and/or microRNA  (miRNA)  -196a  mimic into ESCC cells  (Eca109  cell line). Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium  (MTT) assay and Transwell chamber assay were performed to determine cell proliferation, migration and invasion, respectively. Western blot analysis was used to examine the protein expression levels of ANXA1, Snail and E-cadherin. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of miRNA-196a. Our results revealed that ANXA1 expression was upregulated in the cells transfected with the ANXA1 overexpression plasmid, and cell proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly increased  (p=0.004,  p&lt;0.001 and  p=0.011, respectively). In the cells transfected with the miRNA  -196a  mimic, miRNA  -196a expression was significantly upregulated  (p&lt;0.001). However, miRNA-196a expression was downregulated in the cells transfected with the ANXA1 overexpression plasmid. In addition, in the cells transfected with the miRNA  -196a  mimic, cell proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly decreased  (p=0.027,  p=0.009 and  p=0.021, respectively). In the cells transfected with the ANXA1 overexpression plasmid, the expression of Snail was upregulated and that of E-cadherin was downregulated. However, the opposite was observed in the cells transfected with the miRNA  -196a  mimic. Our findings thus demonstrate that ANXA1 promotes the proliferation of Eca109  cells, and increases the expression of Snail, whereas it inhibits that of E-cadherin, thus enhancing the migration and invasion of ESCC cells. miRNA-196a negatively regulates the expression of ANXA1, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of ESCC cells.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), one of the most aggressive cancers, is characterized by heterogeneous genetic and epigenetic changes. Recently, A-to-I RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), was found to be aberrantly regulated during tumorigenesis. We previously reported that ADAR2 was downregulated in ESCC but its role was unclear. Thus, we report here that overexpression of ADAR2 can induce apoptosis in ESCC cell lines and inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. ADAR2 knockdown inhibited apoptosis in ADAR2 highly expressing tumor cells. RNA-seq assay showed that ADAR2, not ADAR1 or active-site-mutated ADAR2, could edit insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) mRNA in ESCC. IGFBP7 knockdown or ADAR2 catalytic activity destruction abolished the pro-apoptotic function of ADAR2. Mechanistically, RNA editing may stabilize IGFBP7 protein by changing the protease recognition site of matriptase and this is essential for IGFBP7 to induce apoptosis. Western blotting revealed that ADAR2 overexpression could induce IGFBP7-dependent inhibition of Akt signaling. Thus, our data indicate that ADAR2 suppresses tumor growth and induces apoptosis by editing and stabilizing IGFBP7 in ESCC, and this may represent a novel therapeutic target for treating ESCC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Tylosis is an inherited disorder characterized by abnormal palmoplantar skin thickening and a highly elevated risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Analyses of tylosis in families have localized the responsible gene locus to a region of chromosome 17q25.1. Frequent loss of heterozygosity  (LOH) in 17q25.1 was also observed in the sporadic form of ESCC. A putative tumor suppressor gene for ESCC may exist at this locus. We investigated the expression patterns of genes on 17q25.1 in tumor and corresponding normal tissues from patients with sporadic ESCC using RNA sequence analysis. For candidate genes, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), direct sequence, LOH and methylation analyses were performed using 93  clinical ESCC samples and 10  cell lines. A significant downregulation of ST6GALNAC1 was demonstrated in ESCC tissues compared to its expression in normal tissues by qRT-PCR (n=93, p&lt;0.0001). Frequent LOH (17/27, 62.9%) and hyper  -methylation in ST6GALNAC1 were also observed in all cell lines. Our results indicated that ST6GALNAC1 was downregulated in sporadic ESCC via hyper-methylation and LOH, and it may be a candidate responsible gene for ESCC. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that multiple genes on chromosome 17q25 are involved in ESCC development.</text>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>144</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: In this report, we describe the incidental finding of an oropharyngeal mass in a patient who presented with a chief complaint of temporomandibular pain. The patient was initially evaluated by an otorhinolaryngologist for complaints of headaches, earache, and sinus congestion. Due to worsening headaches and trismus, he was further referred for the management of temporomandibular disorder. The clinical evaluation was uneventful except for limited mouth opening (trismus). An advanced radiological evaluation using magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass in the nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal region. The mass occupied the masticatory space and extended superioinferiorly from the skull base to the mandible. A diagnostic biopsy of the lesion revealed a long-standing human papilloma virus (HPV-16)-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. This case illustrates the need for the timely radiological evaluation of seemingly innocuous orofacial pain.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a proinflammatory cytokine mainly produced by T helper 17 cells, exerts protumor or antitumor effects in different cancer entities. However, the exact role of IL-17A in carcinogenesis and progression of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remains unclear. Here, we found that the levels of IL-17A in serum and tumor samples were significantly increased in TSCC patients and positively correlated with tumor metastasis and clinical stage. Besides, IL-17A enhanced cell migration and invasion in SCC15, a TSCC cell line. Furthermore, IL-17A inversely correlated with miR-23b expression in TSCC specimens. In vitro, NF-kB inhibited miR-23b transcription by directly binding to its promoter region. IL-17A downregulated miR-23b expression via activating NF-kB signaling pathway characterized by increasing p65 expression in the nuclear and elevating the levels of p-IKKa and p-IkBa. Overexpression of miR-23b inhibited, whereas knockdown of miR-23b promoted migration and invasion abilities of SCC15 cells. Moreover, extracellular matrix protein versican was proved to be the direct target of miR-23b through luciferase assay. IL-17A increased versican levels in vitro and knockdown of versican by siRNA inhibited SCC15 cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these results reveal a novel mechanism that IL-17A in TSCC microenvironment promotes the migration and invasion of TSCC cells through targeting miR-23b/versican pathway.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). We investigated the proteomic profiles of 45 LADC cell lines with and without LKB1 inactivation. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the first rate-limiting mitochondrial enzyme in the urea cycle, was distinctively overexpressed in LKB1-inactivated LADC cell lines. We therefore assessed the role of CPS1 and its clinical relevance in LKB1-inactivated LADC. METHODS: Mass spectrometric profiling of proteome and metabolome and function of CPS1 were analyzed in LADC cell lines. CPS1 and LKB1 expression in tumors from 305 LADC and 160 lung squamous cell carcinoma patients was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the association between overall survival and CPS1 and LKB1 expression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: CPS1 knockdown reduced cell growth, decreased metabolite levels associated with nucleic acid biosynthesis pathway, and contributed an additive effect when combined with gemcitabine, pemetrexed, or CHK1 inhibitor AZD7762. Tissue microarray analysis revealed that CPS1 was expressed in 65.7% of LKB1-negative LADC, and only 5.0% of LKB1-positive LADC. CPS1 expression showed statistically significant association with poor overall survival in LADC (hazard ratio = 3.03, 95% confidence interval = 1.74 to 5.25, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest functional relevance of CPS1 in LKB1-inactivated LADC and association with worse outcome of LADC. CPS1 is a promising therapeutic target in combination with other chemotherapy agents, as well as a prognostic biomarker, enabling a personalized approach to treatment of LADC.</text>

<text>Real-life efficacy of volumetric modulated arc therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>96</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: There is paucity of data on the efficacy of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The objective of the present study was to investigate outcomes and patterns of recurrence in locally advanced HNSCC treated by VMAT. METHODS: A retrospective study included all patients with stage III or IV HNSCC undergoing curative VMAT. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2013, 130 patients were treated for locally advanced oropharynx (n=55; 42%), hypopharynx (n=38; 29%), larynx (n=22; 17%) or oral cavity (n=15; 12%) SCC. Median age was 60 years (range, 39-85). Median follow-up was 18.1 months (range, 0-43.7). By end of follow-up, 60 patients (46%) had died. Two-year progression-free and overall survival were respectively 63.6% and 77.3% for laryngeal tumors, 60% and 60% for oral cavity tumors, 52.6% and 57.6% for oropharyngeal tumors, and 38.8% and 54.7% for hypopharyngeal tumors. Most recurrences were located within or marginal to radiation therapy fields. CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis is, to our knowledge, the largest study of the efficacy of VMAT in HNSCC. Recurrence patterns and outcomes were consistent with those previously reported for intensity-modulated radiotherapy.</text>

<text>Prognostic significance of preoperative inflammatory response biomarkers in patients undergoing curative thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>172</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have revealed significant relationships between the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and survival in various cancers. The purpose of this study was to confirm whether the LMR, NLR, and PLR have prognostic values, independent of clinicopathological criteria, in patients undergoing curative resection for esophageal cancer. METHODS: The LMR, NLR and PLR were calculated in 147 consecutive patients who underwent curative esophagectomy between January 2006 and December 2014. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to identify the optimal cutoff values of each biomarkers. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis for cancer-specific survival (CSS), pTNM stage (p  &lt;  0.0001) and low LMR (p  =  0.0081) were selected as independent prognostic factor. Similarly, pTNM stage(p  &lt;  0.0001) and low LMR (p  =  0.0225) were found to be independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS). There was no significant relationship between LMR, NLR and PLR and survival in patients with stage I or II, however, significant relationships between LMR and CSS or OS were observed in patients with stage III esophageal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: LMR can be used as a novel predictor of postoperative CSS and OS in patients with esophageal cancer and that it may be useful in identifying patients with a poor prognosis even after radical esophagectomy.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a common and deadly disease. Historically, surgical and chemoradiation treatments have been met with modest success, and understanding of genetic drivers of HNSCC has been limited. With recent next generation sequencing studies focused on HNSCC, we are beginning to understand the genetic landscape of HNSCCs and are starting to identify and advance targeted options for patients. In this review, we describe current knowledge and recent advances in sequencing studies of HNSCC, discuss current limitations and future directions for further genomic analysis, and highlight the translational advances being undertaken to treat this important disease.</text>

<text>Adenosquamous carcinoma in the biliary tract: association of the proliferative ability of the squamous component with its proportion and tumor progression.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>155</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of the proliferative ability of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) component with its proportion and tumor progression in adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) in the biliary tract. METHODS: Nine patients with ASC in the biliary tract (four each in the gallbladder and the extrahepatic bile duct and one in the ampulla of Vater) who underwent surgical resection were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The proportion of the SCC component in the primary sites ranged from 30% to 95%. The Ki-67 index of the SCC component was higher than that of the adenocarcinoma component in all cases, regardless of the component ratio in the patients' primary lesions. Predominance of the SCC component in the advancing region of the tumor, in angiolymphatic invasion and in perineural invasion was observed in most of the cases. The component ratio in metastatic lymph nodes differed from that in the corresponding primary lesions in all six cases with lymph node metastasis. Among these cases, the proportion of the SCC component was increased in the metastatic lymph nodes compared with that in the corresponding primary lesion in two cases, whereas the proportion was decreased in four cases. CONCLUSIONS: The SCC component of ASC in the biliary tract displayed a relatively higher proliferative ability, which might be associated with local invasiveness. However, not only the high proliferative ability of the SCC component but also other biological factors might contribute to tumor progression and metastasis in ASC of the biliary tract.</text>

<text>Apoptotic capacity and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>76</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoke and alcohol drinking are the major risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Smoking and drinking cause DNA damage leading to apoptosis, and insufficient apoptotic capacity may favour development of cancer because of the dysfunction of removing damaged cells. In the present study, we investigated the association between camptothecin (CPT)-induced apoptotic capacity and risk of SCCHN in a North American population. METHODS: In a case-control study of 708 SCCHN patients and 685 matched cancer-free controls, we measured apoptotic capacity in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes  in response to in  vitro exposure to CPT by using the flow cytometry-based method. RESULTS: We found that the mean level of apoptotic capacity in the cases (45.9      23.3%) was significantly lower than that in the controls (49.0      23.1%) (P  =  0.002). When we used the median level of apoptotic capacity in the controls as the cutoff value for calculating adjusted odds ratios, subjects with a reduced apoptotic capacity had an increased risk (adjusted odds ratio  =  1.42, 95% confidence interval  =  1.13-1.78, P  =  0.002), especially for those who were age &gt;= 57 (1.73, 1.25-2.38, 0.0009), men (1.76, 1.36-2.27, &lt;0.0001) and ever drinkers (1.67, 1.27-2.21, 0.0003), and these variables significantly interacted with apoptotic capacity (Pinteraction  =  0.015, 0.005 and 0.009, respectively). A further fitted prediction model suggested that the inclusion of apoptotic capacity significantly improved in the prediction of SCCHN risk. CONCLUSION: Individuals with a reduced CPT-induced apoptotic capacity may be at an increased risk of developing SCCHN, and apoptotic capacity may be a biomarker for susceptibility to SCCHN.</text>

<text>Distant Metastases Following Postoperative Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>116</offset>
<text>Importance: Advances in surgical techniques, the advent of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and the use of concurrent chemotherapy in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have led to improvement of locoregional control (LRC), but not distant control (DC). Moreover, the development of distant metastases (DM) in OSCC has a dismal prognosis. Objective: To determine the characteristics and risk factors of DM following postoperative IMRT in OSCC, and to identify the clinicopathological features that could be associated with distant-only failure (DOF). Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective study of 300 OSCC patients (192 [64%] men and 108 [36%] women) treated with surgery and postoperative IMRT between 2005-2012 in a tertiary cancer center. Interventions: All patients underwent initial primary curative-intent resection with postoperative IMRT with or without concurrent chemotherapy based on predefined risk features. Main Outcomes and Measures: Locoregional control, DC, overall survival (OS), and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade of 3 or higher late toxic effects. Multivariable analysis identified predictors for DM. Results: Overall 300 patients were identified (histological grade 2-3 [G2-3], 285 [95%]; pT3-4, 121 [41%]; pN2-3, 141 [47%]). Positive resection margin was present in 64 of 300 (21%) patients and extracapsular extension in 89 of 281 (32%) neck dissections. Median IMRT dose was 66 Gy and concurrent chemotherapy was used in 73 patients (24%). Median follow-up was 41 months. The 5-year local, regional, and distant control and OS were 85%, 82%, 86%, and 69%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, pN2-3 (hazards ratio, 5.7; 95% CI, 2.2-14.7) and G2-3 (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.8-8.9) were predictive of DM. Thirty-nine patients developed DM, of which 20 (51%) were DOF and 12 (31%) were oligometastatic (&lt;= 5 lesions). The clinicopathological characteristics in DOF were similar to patients with DM subsequent to locoregional failure. In patients with G2-3, pN2-3, and extracapsullar extension (all together), the 5-year cumulative incidence of DOF was 22%. Conclusions and Relevance: Surgery and postoperative IMRT with or without concurrent chemotherapy achieved encouraging outcomes. The clinicopathological characteristics of DOF and DM with locoregional failure were similar. Patients with G2-3, pN2-3, and extracapsullar extension (all together) have higher risk of DOF. Both pN2-3 and G2-3 were independent predictors of DM. Patients with these risk factors may be candidates for prospective clinical trials of intensified therapy or surveillance strategies.</text>

<text>Integrated Analysis of Long Noncoding RNA and mRNA Expression Profile in Advanced Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>116</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays an important role in tumorigenesis. However, the expression pattern and function of lncRNAs in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) are still unclear. To investigate the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in advanced LSCC, we screened lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in 9 pairs of primary Stage IVA LSCC tissues and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues by lncRNA and mRNA integrated microarrays. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis were performed to find out the significant function and pathway of the differentially expressed mRNAs, gene-gene functional interaction network and ceRNA network were constructed to select core mRNAs, and lncRNA-mRNA expression correlation network was built to identify the interactions between lncRNA and mRNA. qRT-PCR was performed to further validate the expressions of selected lncRNAs and mRNAs in advanced LSCC. We found 1459 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 2381 differentially expressed mRNAs, including 846 up-regulated lncRNAs and 613 down-regulated lncRNAs, 1542 up-regulated mRNAs and 839 down-regulated mRNAs. The mRNAs ITGB1, HIF1A, and DDIT4 were selected as core mRNAs, which are mainly involved in biological processes, such as matrix organization, cell cycle, adhesion, and metabolic pathway. LncRNA-mRNA expression correlation network showed LncRNA NR_027340, MIR31HG were positively correlated with ITGB1, HIF1A respectively. LncRNA SOX2-OT was negatively correlated with DDIT4. qRT-PCR further validated the expression of these lncRNAs and mRNAs. The work provides convincing evidence that the identified lncRNAs and mRNAs are potential biomarkers in advanced LSCC for further future studies.</text>

<text>INTRODUCTION: Postablative palatomaxillary defects (PAPMDs) represent a challenging reconstructive problem. Temporalis muscle flap (TMF) has been widely used for reconstruction of these defects with minimal morbidity and satisfactory outcome. AIM OF THE STUDY: To presents the authors' experience in the reconstruction of PAPMDs with TMF and to evaluate the validity of TMF in the reconstruction of such defects. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between July 2011 and July 2016 on selected patients for primary reconstruction of PAPMDs with TMF. Temporalis muscle flaps were assessed during surgery and postoperatively. Patients were followed up to evaluate functional and esthetic outcomes and detect complications. RESULTS: This study included 32 patients with mean age 48.3 years. The pathology was squamous cell carcinoma in 15 patients (46.9%). Twenty-one patients (65.6%) had type II maxillectomy. Mean time of flap harvesting was 43minutes. Zygomatic arch osteotomy was done in 3 patients while Coronoid osteotomy in 4 patients. Postoperatively, flaps were viable in 31 patients (96.9%) with good healing of recipient site. Flap epithelization completed within 28 to 59 days. Follow-up period was 13 to 55 months. Satisfactory functional and esthetic outcomes were reported in most of patients with no recurrence. Transient temporal nerve palsy occurred in 2 patients, limited mouth opening in 5 patients. One patient had Transient diplopia with enopthalmos and hypophthalmos. Flap failure occurred in another patient. CONCLUSIONS: Temporalis muscle flap is still a valid reliable and versatile reconstructive tool in palatomaxillary reconstruction after ablative surgery. It has a good cosmetic and functional outcomes and minimal morbidity.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVE: Salvage surgery has a higher complication rate compared to primary surgical treatment. We evaluated clinical outcome of salvage neck dissections in relation to initial treatment modality, extent of surgery, and patient related factors. DESIGN: Single institution consecutive case series. SETTING: Tertiary Head and Neck Cancer Center. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, who underwent salvage neck dissection after initial radiotherapy (n=30), radiotherapy with carboplatin/5-fluorouracil (n=43), or radiotherapy with cetuximab (n=14). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of complications, disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Complications occurred in 28% of the patients. Multivariate analysis identified extent of neck dissection as the only independent predictor of surgical complications (p = .010). Surgical complication rate was 16% after radiotherapy with systemic treatment, and 47% after radiotherapy alone (p = .171). The 5-year disease-specific survival was 55%, independent of complications, initial treatment, extent of surgery, and patient related factors. CONCLUSION: The only predictor for surgical complications was extent of surgery. Survival was not influenced by complications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</text>

<text>Frequency of Delayed Diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Pakistan</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>74</offset>
<text>Objectives: To determine the frequency of delayed diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma in our setup; highlighting factors responsible for any delay and their possible relevance to demographic and diagnostic features. Methods: This cross sectional study of six months duration was conducted in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the Armed Forces Institute of Dentistry, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. A total of 246 patients, both male and female, having a biopsy proven definitive diagnosis of OSCC were included using a consecutive sampling technique. Delay in diagnosis was assessed from the stated period of time from when the patient first noticed symptoms of disease until a definitive diagnosis was made. We concluded delayed diagnosis if this was more than 40 days. Results: The ages of patients ranged from 27 to 60 years with a mean of 46.7    10.2 years and a marked male predominance (3.7:1). Delayed diagnosis was observed in 91.5% of cases. However, statistically no significant differences were found with age, gender, marital, education status, household income and time of biopsy. Conclusion: Our primary finding of delayed diagnosis with no prior contact with any health care professional clearly reflects a need of taking urgent measures to avoid serious impacts on morbidity and mortality associated with OSCC.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Minichromosome maintenance protein 7 (MCM7) is a downstream of human epidermal growth receptor (HER1) signaling. We examined MCM7, geminin, and HER1 expression in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with radiotherapy and cetuximab. METHODS: MCM7, geminin, and HER1 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on 61 patients with laryngeal SCC. The follow-up (median, 32.1 months; range, 2-139 months) went from the beginning of therapy to tumor progression-free survival (PFS) and death (overall survival [OS]). RESULTS: MCM7, but not geminin, was associated only with HER1 expression, whereas no association was found with other clinicopathological characteristics. Patients with MCM7 high - geminin high and MCM7 high - geminin low tumor status had a risk of progression 3.1 times and 17.7 times greater, respectively, than patients with MCM7 low - geminin high tumor status. Tumor site, MCM7, and geminin were independent determinants of PFS, whereas MCM7 was an independent prognostic marker of OS. CONCLUSION: MCM7-geminin tumor status may be prognostic for patients with laryngeal SCC treated with cetuximab and radiotherapy.    2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2016.</text>

<text>Timing of neck dissection in association with transoral surgery: A systematic review.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>85</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to present our evaluation of the importance of timing (early vs synchronous vs delayed) in conjunction with transoral laser surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: Articles addressing surgical management via transoral laser surgery for HNSCC were included for review. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles fulfilled our criteria. The overall 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) was 75.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.3-83.9) and locoregional control was 87.3% (95% CI, 82.3-92.1), respectively. In the synchronous neck dissection group, the mean locoregional control was 89.9% (95% CI, 84.8-95.1) versus 84.5% (95% CI, 56.2-112.7) for the delayed neck dissection group. From studies in which complications were explicitly given, a bleeding rate of 5.3% (95% CI, 3.6-6.9) was established. There were 11.1% of patients who underwent a tracheostomy. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence to indicate that timing of neck dissection after transoral laser surgery for HNSCC has any effect on overall survival (OS).    2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

<text>Cardiovascular risk and prevention in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>99</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The underlying contributors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are poorly characterized. METHODS: Patients with HNSCC who underwent definitive or adjuvant (chemo)radiation between 2011 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The 10-year risk estimates for a CVD event were calculated according to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). RESULTS: One hundred fifteen patients with predominantly stage III/IV HNSCC had a median follow-up of 2 years. At diagnosis, 23% of patients had CVD. The FRS was higher among patients with laryngeal cancer versus other sites (20.5% vs 14.4%). Twenty-four percent of all patients had uncontrolled blood pressure at diagnosis. Among the patients with CVD, 41% were not taking antiplatelet therapy and 30% were not taking statin therapy. Thirty-four percent of patients without CVD had indications for initiating statin therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with HNSCC have a high baseline CVD risk and many do not receive optimal preventive care.    2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2016.</text>

<offset>117</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to present our evaluation of the outcomes of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: This was a prospective phase II study. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR). Patients with locally/regionally advanced cutaneous SCC deemed unsuitable for surgery received definitive radiotherapy (RT; 70 Gy in 35fractions) and concurrent weekly platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin 40 mg/m2 or carboplatin area under the curve 2). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled in this study. Eighteen patients had a locally advanced primary or nodal disease in the head and neck region with 66% having stage IV nonmetastatic disease. Of 19 evaluable patients, 10 achieved a CR to definitive CRT with 2 further patients rendered disease-free by salvage surgery for an overall CR of 63%. CONCLUSION: This is the only prospective series of CRT for cutaneous SCC. A high CR rate was documented in patients with locoregional advanced disease who were unable to undergo surgery.    2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2016.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Bcl-2 and Twist1 can be coactivated by hypoxia in hepatocellular carcinoma to promote tumor cell metastasis and vasculogenic mimicry, but their function in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains undefined. We employed a cohort of 82 cases of OSCC samples to examine the coexpression of Bcl-2 and Twist1 by immunohistochemistry and demonstrate the interaction between Bcl-2 and Twist1 by coimmunoprecipitation. Bcl-2 and Twist1 overexpression was associated with a poor pathological grade and tumor prognosis, and the two factors functions as a complex. Knocking down Bcl-2/Twist1 inhibited cell migration, decreased cell invasion and inversed cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) procession. An animal model derived from the Tca8113 cell line was used to further validate the role of Bcl-2/Twist1 depletion in suppressing tumor EMT and growth. In conclusion, Bcl-2/Twist1 complex can be treated as a potential therapeutic target for OSCC.</text>

<text>Aim: To assess the diagnostic utility of serum and salivary interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in the differential diagnosis of potentially malignant lesions and conditions (PMLs/PMCs) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in a high oral cancer prevalence region. Methods: After appropriate ethical clearance and informed consent, salivary and blood samples were collected from 100 participants in each group (OSCC, PMLs, and healthy controls). Serum and salivary IL-6 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and data were subjected to appropriate statistical analysis. Results: Significant differences in IL-6 concentration were noted between OSCC and PML/C patients in both serum and saliva, with salivary levels being 2 to 3 fold higher than serum values in all the groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated 96% specificity and 99% sensitivity for salivary IL-6 in differentiating PML from OSCC. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, is elevated in the saliva of patients with OSSC compared to PMD and controls, and thus may prove to have diagnostic and/or prognostic significance.</text>

<text>TILs in Head and Neck Cancer: Ready for Clinical Implementation and Why (Not)?</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>78</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: The assessment of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has recently emerged as a prognostic biomarker in several solid tumors. Quantification and subtyping of TILs reflects the immune response in the tumor microenvironment, contributing to either tumoral immune attack or escape and thereby affecting outcome. Despite the growing evidence of its value as prognosticator, TILs analysis has not yet found its way to daily clinical practice. The aim of this review is to evaluate whether the current knowledge on TILs in head and neck cancer justifies its clinical implementation. Therefore, we summarize the data on TILs in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck with focus on the most important subsets (T lymphocytes and more specifically CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells and FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells) and site-specific characteristics such as Human Papilloma Virus infection. In addition, we discuss methodological problems and pitfalls that can account for discordant findings and that may hamper inclusion of TILs assessment in routine practice of pathologists and oncologists.</text>

<text>Detection of human papilloma virus in potentially malignant and malignant lesions of the oral cavity and a study of associated risk factors.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>140</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is the 6(th) most frequently occurring cancer worldwide, with over 400,000 cases projected annually. Multiple factors such as tobacco, alcohol, irradiation, virus, and chronic irritants are involved in the development of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). The most important risk factors are chronic exposure to tobacco and alcohol. Although the evidence that implicates virus is increasing, particularly (human papillomavirus [HPV]), in the carcinogenesis process, the role of virus is not well established. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to assess the presence of HPV in potentially malignant and malignant lesions of the oral cavity as well as to correlate the presence of HPV with addictive habits and histopathological grading of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsy samples of OSCC and potentially malignant lesions were obtained and 3, 5  m thickness sections were cut using a microtome. The sections were collected using a sterile brush and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction for the detection of HPV were done. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The association between histopathological grading and presence of HPV was assessed using Chi-square test and the values thus obtained were found to be statistically significant. HPV was more predominantly seen in well-differentiated carcinomas and moderately differentiated carcinomas as compared to poorly differentiated carcinomas.</text>

<text>Differences in T-cell infiltrates and survival between HPV+ and HPV- oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>107</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Recent studies have suggested that immune cells as part of tumor's microenvironment could partly explain the better outcome in HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma. We performed a systematic review of the literature focused on differences in immune-infiltrate in HPV+ versus HPV- oropharyngeal cancers. This comprehensive search yielded 4308 original papers, of which 20 satisfied our eligibility criteria. Increase in both circulating and tumor infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes is mainly seen in HPV+ oropharyngeal carcinoma. Interestingly, the survival benefit associated with increase in immune cells is equal both in HPV+ and HPV- oropharyngeal cancer. Based on these results, our review underscores the role of the immune system in the biological and clinical behavior of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) and might open doors to further investigate immune modulatory treatment options in OPSCC patients.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Hypoxia is a negative prognostic factor and this study investigated the relationship between hypoxia, hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and AKT signaling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RESULTS/METHODOLOGY: pAKT was induced by hypoxia (0.5% O2) in a part of HNSCC (3/4) and squamous (2/3) and adenocarcinoma (1/3) NSCLS lines. AKT-inhibitor MK-2206 reduced hypoxic HIF-1 signaling in most HNSCC cell lines. This reduction did not correlate with hypoxic induction of pAKT or with sensitivity to MK-2206 under hypoxia. Patient biopsies revealed a hypoxia-induced expression pattern of pAKT in HNSCC (n = 16), which was not observed in squamous cell (n = 34) or adenocarcinoma (n = 41) NSCLC. CONCLUSION: The interaction between hypoxia, HIF-1 and AKT signaling varies between tumor types and histologies, which could significantly affect response to targeted therapies.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Previous reports show that phospholipase C epsilon-1 (PLCE1) expression is positively correlated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas; however, the expression of PLCE1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its correlation with clinical outcome still remain unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the expression of PLCE1 in HCC tissue and to determine whether PLCE1 was a prognostic factor for HCC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PLCE1 levels in 20 paired HCC tissues and corresponding paracarcinomatous tissues was investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays. In addition, protein levels of PLCE1 in one normal liver epithelial cell and four HCC cell lines were examined using Western blot assay. Moreover, immunohistochemistry was applied to determine the expression of PLCE1 in HCC and corresponding surrounding tissues from 90 patients. Statistical analyses were used to examine the association between PLCE1 levels and clinicopathological features. RESULTS: We found that the expression of PLCE1 in tumor tissues was significantly lower than those in paracarcinomatous tissues at both mRNA and protein levels (P&lt;0.05). We also determined that PLCE1 protein expression levels were lower in HCC cell lines than normal liver epithelial cells (P&lt;0.05). Notably, immunohistochemical assay showed that PLCE1 expression was significantly low in HCC tissues compared with the adjacent normal liver tissues (40% vs 18.9%; P&lt;0.05). Besides, PLCE1 levels were negatively correlated with tumor capsulae, vascular invasion, Edmondson grade, alpha-fetoprotein, and tumor-node-metastasis stage (P&lt;0.05). Univariate analysis revealed that lower level expression of PLCE1 was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (OS) rate (P&lt;0.001) and disease-free survival rate (P&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that low PLCE1 level was an independent poor prognostic factor of OS and recurrence-free survival (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: In brief, our results revealed that decreased PLCE1 expression was associated with tumor progression in HCC and may function as a promising biomarker for HCC prognosis.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: To establish treatments to improve the prognosis of cancer patients, it is necessary to find new targets to control metastasis. We found that expression of FilaminC (FLNC), a member of the actin binding and cross-linking filamin protein family is correlated with lymphatic invasion and lymphatic metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by increasing cell motility through activation of Rho GTPase.Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that FLNC expression in ESCC is associated with lymphatic invasion, metastasis, and prognosis. FLNC knockdown in esophageal cancer cell lines decreased cell migration in wound healing and transwell migration assays, and invasion in transwell migration assays. Furthermore, FLNC knockdown reduced the amount of activated Rac-1 (GTP-Rac1) and activated Cdc42 (GTP-Cdc42). Our results suggest that FLNC expression is a useful biomarker of ESCC metastatic tendency and that inhibiting FLNC function may be useful to control the metastasis of ESCC.</text>

<offset>112</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: Early hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC) is a rarely diagnosed disease, for which the optimal treatment has not been defined yet. We assessed patterns of failure and outcomes in early HPSCC treated with various therapeutic approaches to identify its optimal treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients with stage I (n = 10) and II (n = 26) treated between January 1992 and March 2014 were reviewed. Patients received definitive radiotherapy (RT) (R group, n = 10), surgery only (S group, n = 19), or postoperative RT (PORT group, n = 7). All patients in both the R and PORT groups received elective bilateral neck irradiation. In the S group, 7 patients had ipsilateral and 8 had bilateral dissection, while 4 patients had no elective dissection. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 48 months, the 5-year locoregional control (LRC) rate was 65%. Six patients had local failure, 1 regional failure (RF), 3 combined locoregional failures, and 2 distant failures. There was no difference in 5-year LRC among the R, S, and PORT groups (p = 0.17). The presence with a pyriform sinus apex extension was a prognosticator related to LRC (p = 0.01) in the multivariate analysis. Patients with a bilaterally treated neck showed a trend toward a lower RF rate (p = 0.08). CONCLUSION: This study shows that patients with early stage HPSCC involving the pyriform sinus apex might need a tailored approach to improve LRC. Additionally, our study confirms elective neck treatment might have an efficacious role in regional control.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Recent findings on the existence of oncogenic fusion genes in a wide array of solid tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), suggests that fusion genes have become attractive targets for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we showed for the first time that a read-through fusion gene JMJD7-PLA2G4B is presented in HNSCC, splicing neighboring jumonji domain containing 7 (JMJD7) and phospholipase A2, group IVB (PLA2G4B) genes together. Ablation of JMJD7-PLA2G4B significantly inhibited proliferation of HNSCC cells by promoting G1 cell cycle arrest and increased starvation-induced cell death compared to JMJD7-only knockdown HNSCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that JMJD7-PLA2G4B modulates phosphorylation of Protein Kinase B (AKT) to promote HNSCC cell survival. Moreover, JMJD7-PLA2G4B also regulated an E3 ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) to control the cell cycle progression from G1 phase to S phase by inhibiting Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21) and 1B (p27) expression. Our study provides novel insights into the oncogenic control of JMJD7-PLA2G4B in HNSCC cell proliferation and survival, and suggests that JMJD7-PLA2G4B may serve as an important therapeutic target and prognostic marker for HNSCC development and progression.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: High recurrence and lower survival rates in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are associated with its bone invasion. We identified the oncogenic role of RUNX3 during bone invasion by OSCC. Tumor growth and the generation of osteolytic lesions were significantly inhibited in mice that were subcutaneously inoculated with RUNX3-knockdown human OSCC cells. RUNX3 knockdown enhanced TGF-b-induced growth arrest and inhibited OSCC cell migration and invasion in the absence or presence of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), a major growth factor abundant in the bone microenvironment. RUNX3 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 and G2 phases and promoted G2 arrest by TGF-b in Ca9.22 OSCC cells. RUNX3 knockdown also inhibited both the basal and TGF-b-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by increasing E-cadherin expression and suppressing the nuclear translocation of b-catenin. In addition, the expression and TGF-b-mediated induction of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), one of key osteolytic factors, was blocked in RUNX3-knockdown OSCC cells. Furthermore, treating human osteoblastic cells with conditioned medium derived from RUNX3-knockdown OSCC cells reduced the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin ratio compared with treatment with conditioned medium from RUNX3-expressing cells. These findings indicate that RUNX3 expression in OSCC cells contributes to their bone invasion and the resulting osteolysis by inducing their malignant behaviors and production of osteolytic factors. RUNX3 alone or in combination with TGF-b and PTHrP may be a useful predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for bone invasion by oral cancer.</text>

<text>Circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for oral squamous cell carcinoma recurrence in operated patients.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>98</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory non-coding RNAs for which altered expression in cancers can serve as potential biomarkers for diseases. We here investigated whether circulating miRNAs can serve as biomarkers for predicting post-operational recurrence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in patients. Plasma samples from 8 Danish OSCC patients were collected before, and one year after surgical operation, as well as from 3 Danish healthy controls and subjected to miRNA profiling by next generation sequencing. Disease recurrence did not occur in the 8 patients when the post-operative plasma samples were collected. Based on the sequencing data, three up-regulated miRNAs (miR-148a-3p, miR-26a-5p and miR-21-5p) and three down-regulated miRNAs (miR-375, miR-92b-3p and miR-486-5p) in the OSCC samples compared to healthy controls were selected for qRT-PCR validation in a Chinese cohort of 20 plasma samples collected before, and 9-12 months after surgical operation, and 18 healthy controls. Disease recurrence had occurred in 8 out of the 20 Chinese patients at the time their post-operative plasma samples were collected. The results of qRT-PCR showed that down-regulation of miR-486-5p, miR-375 and miR-92b-3p were highly associated with OSCC recurrence. This study indicates that the plasma miRNA profile is altered in OSCC during its progression and can be used to monitor the likelihood of OSCC recurrence in patients after surgery.</text>

<text>Pathologic Evaluation of Skin Tumors With Ex Vivo Dermoscopy With Derm Dotting.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>79</offset>
<text>Importance: Ex vivo dermoscopy (EVD) with derm dotting (DD) improves clinicopathologic correlation and the quality of diagnosis in skin tumors. Objective: To compare the diagnostic performance of the standard method of skin biopsy processing with the practice of EVD with DD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective study compares the diagnostic performance in 6526 skin biopsy specimens examined from 2008 to 2010 with a standard method of processing with 8584 biopsy specimens examined in 2015 with EVD and DD. Data were analyzed from January 1 to March 31, 2016. A total of 15   110 skin biopsy specimens were included. The biopsy specimens from 2008 to 2010 were processed in a hospital-based general pathology laboratory; the biopsy specimens from 2015 were processed in a private dermatopathology laboratory. Biopsy specimens from both periods were diagnosed by the same dermatopathologist. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measures were clinicopathological characteristics, usefulness of EVD with DD, and turnaround times (TATs). Results: Use of EVD with DD increased the detection of positive section margins in nonmelanoma skin cancer from 8.4% to 12.8%. The most significant increase was seen in Bowen disease, invasive squamous cell carcinoma, and a superficial type of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). With EVD and DD, a specific clinicopathologic diagnosis was made in 27.7% of nevi compared with only 10.3% using the standard method. The incidence of moderately and severely dysplastic nevi increased from 1.0% to 7.2% and from 0.6% to 1.4%, respectively. The detection of ulceration in melanomas with thicker than 1 mm increased from 24.0% to 31.3%. The number of nevi-associated melanomas increased from 15.5% to 33.3%. The number of collision lesions from 0.07% to 1.07%. The TAT for nevi decreased from 2 days to 1 day, for melanomas from 5 days to 2 days, and for BCC from 2 days to 1 day. Conclusions and Relevance: Ex vivo dermoscopy and DD with adapted sectioning in a dermatopathology setting allows a more accurate and less time consuming histopathologic diagnosis of skin tumors. These findings suggest that pathologists involved in skin tumor evaluation should be encouraged to learn dermoscopy and replace random transverse cutting with lesion-specific and DD-guided cutting.</text>

<text>An Interesting Case of Basal Cell Carcinoma with Raynaud's Phenomenon Following Chronic Arsenic Exposure.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>110</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Arsenic is commonly known to be associated with squamous cell carcinoma. Among the lesser known associations is basal cell carcinoma and even rarer is its effect on blood vessels causing peripheral vascular disease. Here we present a case of a 55 yr old man with ulceroproliferative lesions on scalp and forehead along with several hyperpigmented patches on trunk and extremities. He had symptoms suggestive of Raynaud's phenomenon that eventually led to digital gangrene. FNAC was done which was suggestive of basal cell carcinoma. On further enquiry, he was found to reside in an arsenic endemic zone and was investigated for blood arsenic level which was elevated. Punch biopsy from different lesions from body confirmed nodular basal cell carcinoma. Presently the patient has stopped drinking water from the local tubewell. On follow-up he shows improvement of Raynaud's phenomenon and  skin  lesions.</text>

<text>Regional hyperthermia combined with radiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with supraclavicular lymph node metastasis.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>131</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: To assess the efficacy and toxicity of Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and hyperthermia for upper and middle thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (UMT-ESCC) with supraclavicular lymph node metastasis. A total of 50 patients with UMT-ESCC with supraclavicular lymph node metastasis were evaluated in this retrospective study. All patients received IMRT. Hyperthermia was delivered simultaneously with irradiation, in 45 minutes twice a week for 5-6 weeks. Hyperthermia included supraclavicular lymph node metastasis. Forty-four patients (88.0%) received concurrent chemoradiotherapy based on cisplatin regimens. The most common types of hematological toxicities were anemia (62.0%) and leukopenia (60.0%). Most of these events were grade 1-2 and transient. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate were 34.9% and 42.5%, respectively. Cox regression revealed that tumor length and number of supraclavicular lymph node metastasis were two independent predictors of OS (tumor length: HR=3.65, p=0.008; nodal stage: HR=8.07, p=0.019). The IMRT combined with supraclavicular regional hyperthermia has low toxicity and well tolerated with excellent local control in UMT-ESCC with supraclavicular lymph node metastasis.</text>

<text>Long term results from a prospective database on high dose rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy for primary cervical carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>128</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: Present long-term outcomes in primary cervical cancer treated with external beam and high dose rate interstitial brachytherapy. METHODS: High dose rate (HDR) interstitial (IS) brachytherapy (BT) and external beam (EBRT) were administered from 1992 to 2009 to 315 patients who were unsuitable for intracavitary (IC) BT alone. Histology was 89% squamous cell, 8% adenocarcinoma, and 3% adenosquamous. FIGO stage was I-14%, II-47%, III-34%, and IVA-5%. Median tumor size was 6cm. Lymph node metastases were 26% pelvic and 9.5% para-aortic. Treatment planning was 49% 2D and 51% 3D-CT. The mean doses were central EBRT EQD210 37.3  4.3Gy (sidewall 49.2  3.6Gy) and HDR EQD210 42.3  5.3Gy (nominal 5.4Gy*6 fractions using a mean of 24 catheters and 1 tandem). Total EQD210 mean target dose was 79.5  5.4Gy. Standardized planned dose constraints were ICRU points or D0.1cc bladder 80%, rectum 75% and urethra 90% of the HDR dose per fraction. Morbidity assessment was CTCAEv3. Median and mean follow-up were 50 and 61months (3-234). RESULTS: The 10-year actuarial local control was 87%, regional control 84%, and loco-regional control 77%. Distant metastasis free survival was 66%, cause specific survival 56%, disease free survival 54%, and overall survival 40%. The rates of late grade GU and GI toxicities were 4.8% G3 and 5.4% G4. CONCLUSIONS: Template-guided interstitial can be safely performed to successfully deliver high radiation dose to locally advanced cervix cancer and avoid excessive dose and injury to adjacent vital pelvic organs. We achieved high tumor control with low morbidity in patients who were poor candidates for intracavitary brachytherapy.</text>

<text>Prognostic factors in mandibular gingival squamous cell carcinoma: A 10-year retrospective study.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>97</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: The mandibular gingiva is the second most common site of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. This retrospective study was designed to determine the clinicopathological features of squamous cell carcinoma of the mandibular gingiva (MGSCC) and to establish a new risk model to predict overall survival. The study included 207 patients with primary MGSCC from January 2000 to September 2009. The medical charts were reviewed and data related to clinical characteristics, treatment provided, histopathological analysis, and follow-up were recorded. All patients underwent surgery as the first-line therapy; follow-up ranged from 1 to 171 months (median 63 months). Clinical characteristics and pathological outcomes were analyzed with respect to the 5-year overall survival rate. A survival risk model was established, and patients were classified into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups based on the prognostic index designed in this study. The 5-year overall survival rates for the low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups were 92.3%, 76.9%, and 34.2%, respectively. Pathological node metastasis, perineural invasion, and extracapsular spread were the most significant predictive factors for 5-year overall survival. MGSCC is not aggressive, and the survival outcomes of MGSCC are better than those of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) at other sites. It is suggested that patients with T2-T4 tumours undergo elective neck dissection and those with T1 tumours be followed up without addressing the neck.</text>

<offset>223</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Purpose Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is treatment-responsive. Definitive chemoradiation results in high cure rates but causes long-term toxicity and may represent overtreatment of some patients. This phase II trial evaluated whether complete clinical response (cCR) to induction chemotherapy (IC) could select patients with HPV-associated OPSCC for reduced radiation dose as a means of sparing late sequelae. Methods Patients with HPV16 and/or p16-positive, stage III-IV OPSCC received three cycles of IC with cisplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab. Patients with primary-site cCR to IC received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 54 Gy with weekly cetuximab; those with less than cCR to IC at the primary site or nodes received 69.3 Gy and cetuximab to those regions. The primary end point was 2-year progression-free survival. Results Of the 90 patients enrolled, 80 were evaluable. Their median age was 57 years (range, 35 to 73 years), with the majority having stage T1-3N0-N2b OPSCC and a history of &lt; 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking. Three cycles of IC were delivered to 77 of the 80 patients. Fifty-six patients (70%) achieved a primary-site cCR to IC and 51 patients continued to cetuximab with IMRT 54 Gy. After median follow-up of 35.4 months, 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 80% and 94%, respectively, for patients with primary-site cCR treated with 54 Gy of radiation (n = 51); 96% and 96%, respectively, for patients with &lt; T4, &lt; N2c, and &lt; 10 pack-year smoking history who were treated with &lt;=  54 Gy of radiation (n = 27). At 12 months, significantly fewer patients treated with a radiation dose &lt;=  54 Gy had difficulty swallowing solids (40% v 89%; P = .011) or had impaired nutrition (10% v 44%; P = .025). Conclusion For IC responders, reduced-dose IMRT with concurrent cetuximab is worthy of further study in favorable-risk patients with HPV-associated OPSCC. Radiation dose reduction resulted in significantly improved swallowing and nutritional status.</text>

<text>Impact of histological subtype on survival in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer that were treated with definitive radiotherapy: adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>211</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: To compare the survival outcomes of patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma (AC/ASC) among patients with locally advanced cervical cancer that were treated with definitive radiotherapy. METHODS: The baseline characteristics and outcome data of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer who were treated with definitive radiotherapy between November 1993 and February 2014 were collected and retrospectively reviewed. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to investigate the prognostic significance of AC/ASC histology. RESULTS: The patients with AC/ASC of the cervix exhibited significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (p=0.004) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.002) than the patients with SCC of the cervix. Multivariate analysis showed that AC/ASC histology was an independent negative prognostic factor for PFS. Among the patients who displayed AC/ASC histology, larger tumor size, older age, and incomplete response to radiotherapy were found to be independent prognostic factors. PFS was inversely associated with the number of poor prognostic factors the patients exhibited (the estimated 1-year PFS rates; 100.0%, 77.8%, 42.8%, 0.0% for 0, 1, 2, 3 factors, respectively). CONCLUSION: Locally advanced cervical cancer patients with AC/ASC histology experience significantly worse survival outcomes than those with SCC. Further clinical studies are warranted to develop a concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) protocol that is specifically tailored to locally advanced cervical AC/ASC.</text>

<text>PURPOSE: Several studies have evaluated the association between ABO blood group and the prognosis of various types of cancer; however, little is known about the relationship between ABO blood group and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We investigated how ABO blood group and clinicopathological characteristics are related to the survival of Japanese patients with esophageal SCC. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 181 patients who underwent surgery for esophageal SCC between June, 2004 and December, 2015 and analyzed the association between ABO blood group and clinicopathological factors. Clinicopathological factors were also evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses for possible association with survival. RESULTS: The prevalence of each blood group was as follows: A, 35.5%; B, 22.4%; O, 32.8%; and AB, 8.2%. The 5-year overall survival of all patients was 37.1%. Patients with non-type B blood had significantly worse 5-year overall survival than those with type B blood (30.2 vs. 58.8%, P  &lt;  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ABO blood groups were associated with the survival of Japanese patients with esophageal SCC. Patients with non-B blood groups had significantly worse overall survival than those with the B blood group.</text>

<text>Transoral laser microsurgery for T1b glottic cancer: review of 51 cases.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>72</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: For the treatment of T1b glottic carcinoma, different treatment options, such as transoral laser microsurgery, open surgical techniques, and primary radiotherapy, are under discussion. In this context, the aim of the present study was to describe oncologic results and complication rates of transoral laser microsurgery in treatment of T1b glottic carcinoma. This is a retrospective unicenter chart review of patients treated at an academic tertiary referral center between 1986 and 2006. Fifty-one previously untreated T1b cases were exclusively treated by transoral laser microsurgery and included into this study, 47 were male, and 4 were female. The main outcome measures included local control rate and complications, overall, disease specific, and recurrence-free survival. The median follow-up period was 98  months. The 5-year local control rate was 90.2%; larynx preservation rate was 92.2%. No intra- or postoperative complications, such as wound infections, postoperative bleeding, hematoma, edema, and fistula development, were observed. A single patient required revision surgery due to synechia. Five-year survival rates were: overall 84.7%, disease specific 97.7%, and recurrence free 72.4%. Our data support the conclusion that transoral laser microsurgery is a considerable treatment option in T1b glottic carcinoma. The oncologic outcome was at least comparable to other treatment options, while the perioperative morbidity and complication rate were lower.</text>

<text>Prophylactic steroid administration for strictures after endoscopic resection of large superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>134</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Background and study aims: One of the major complications after endoscopic resection (ER) for large superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is benign esophageal stricture, which can reduce quality of life even if ESCC achieves a cure without organ resection. Recently, steroid administration has been reported as a prophylactic treatment to prevent esophageal strictures. This retrospective study evaluated the stricture rate according to the different width of mucosal defects due to ER and compared it to that seen with prophylactic steroid administration. Patients and methods: Between June 2007 and December 2013, we enrolled patients with ESCC who had 3/4 or larger circumferential mucosal defects due to ER. In December 2009, steroid injections (triamcinolone acetonide 50mg) into the ulcer bed due to ER were introduced. Beginning in November 2012, we commenced oral steroid administration (prednisolone 30mg/day, tapered gradually for 8 weeks) in addition to steroid injection. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the width of mucosal defect after ER (Group A, &gt;= 3/4 and &lt;7/8; Group B, &gt;= 7/8 and less than the entire circumference; and Group C, the entire circumference). We retrospectively evaluated the stricture rate by comparing no treatment, steroid injection, or steroid injection followed by oral steroid according to the width of mucosal defect. Results: A total of 115 patients met the selection criteria. In Group B, no treatment had a significantly higher stricture rate (100%, vs. steroid injection: 56% P=0.015; vs steroid injection followed by oral steroid: 20% P&lt;0.001). Conversely, in Group C, the stricture rate was high, regardless of treatment (no treatment: 100%; steroid injection: 100%; steroid injection followed by oral steroid: 71%). Conclusions: Although prophylactic steroid administration is effective to prevent strictures for 7/8 circumference or larger mucosal defects, it is ineffective for whole-circumference defects. Further investigation is required.</text>

<text>From blood to breath: New horizons for esophageal cancer biomarkers.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>68</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Esophageal cancer is a lethal cancer encompassing adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma sub-types. The global incidence of esophageal cancer is increasing world-wide, associated with the increased prevalence of associated risk factors. The asymptomatic nature of disease often leads to late diagnosis and five-year survival rates of less than 15%. Current diagnostic tools are restricted to invasive and costly endoscopy and biopsy for histopathology. Minimally and non-invasive biomarkers of esophageal cancer are needed to facilitate earlier detection and better clinical management of patients. This paper summarises recent insights into the development and clinical validation of esophageal cancer biomarkers, focussing on circulating markers in the blood, and the emerging area of breath and odorant biomarkers.</text>

<text>Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Pleura: A Rare Complication of Hidradenitis Suppurativa.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>98</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: BACKGROUND Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), also known as Marjolin ulcer, is a rare complication of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Metastatic SCC from HS typically involves the axial skeleton or abdominopelvic viscera. Metastatic disease to the lungs is a rare phenomenon with only three reported cases of lung parenchyma. We present a biopsy proven case of metastatic SCC to the pleura from gluteal HS. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old male with a history of recently diagnosed Marjolin ulcer secondary to gluteal HS was transferred to our intensive care unit for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to recurrent pleural effusion. On examination, patient was febrile (38.3   C), normotensive (blood pressure 98/65 mm Hg), tachycardic (116 beats/minute) and tachypneic (40 breaths/minute) with oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. He was in moderate distress requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally and skin examination was significant for 18 cm wide sacral lesion. CT thorax showed bilateral pleural effusions, pleural thickening, and scattered nodular densities within both lungs concerning for metastatic disease. Thoracentesis showed lymphocyte predominant exudate with negative cytology for malignant cells. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) illustrated thickened pleural rind with histopathology and positive p40 stain consistent with invasive well-to-moderately differentiated keratinizing SCC.   CONCLUSIONS SCC arising from HS is rare and metastatic disease to the pleura has not been reported previously. Strong clinical suspicion for malignancy is warranted in patients with advanced HS and evolving pulmonary symptoms despite negative cytology.</text>

<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>155</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The role of neoadjuvant therapy combined with surgery for treating esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains controversial. We performed a network meta-analysis to synthesize direct and indirect evidence to identify the optimal therapeutic method for ESCC. METHODS: We identified 15 randomized controlled trials that compared any of the following 4 therapeutic measures: surgery alone (S), preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery (CTS), preoperative radiotherapy followed by surgery (RTS), and preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (CRTS). The main outcomes were 5-year survival, rate of radical resection, operative mortality and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Network meta-analysis showed that CRTS was associated with improved survival as compared with S (OR  =  1.50 [95% CI 1.21 to 1.97]) and decreased occurrence of complications as compared with RTS (OR  =  0.50 [95% CI 0.22 to 0.99]). Direct evidence revealed CRTS associated with improved survival (OR  =  1.61 [95% CI 1.01 to 2.57]) and radical resection (OR  =  4.01 [95% CI 1.66 to 9.69]) as compared with S. In terms of radical resection, CTS was more effective than S (OR  =  1.73 [95% CI 1.09 to 2.76]). Findings for CTS and RTS did not differ for 5-year survival, operative mortality and postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, CRTS might be the best choice for resectable ESCC because it could increase the radical resection rate and lower the occurrence of complications, thereby prolonging survival time.</text>

<text>(18)F-FDG PET/CT surveillance for the detection of recurrence in patients with head and neck cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>100</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Posttreatment detection of recurrence may lead to salvage treatment and prognostic prediction in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic values of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) after definitive treatment of HNSCC. METHODS: This prospective study included 278 consecutive patients who underwent curative surgery (n  =  143, 51.4%) or definitive radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy (n  =  135, 48.6%) for previously untreated HNSCC. The patients were regularly followed up and evaluated by (18)F-FDG PET/CT, head and neck CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and chest CT at regular intervals after treatment. The imaging interpretations were compared with the histological results for recurrence. Receiver operating characteristics curves analysis, McNemar's test and logistic regression using generalised estimating equations were used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and standard imaging of CT/MRI or chest CT, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the prognostic value of PET/CT. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 24-62 months), 73 patients (26.3%) had recurrence or persistent diseases. The area under curves for (18)F-FDG PET/CT and CT/MRI were 0.975 (0.964-0.992) and 0.789 (0.713-0.874), respectively (P  &lt;  0.001). (18)F-FDG PET/CT detected 65 of 66 recurrences (98.5%) not suggested by physical examination and endoscopy. Positive findings on (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans were independent predictors of poorer cancer-specific and overall survival outcomes (P  &lt;  0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Posttreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT surveillance helps to properly detect recurrence and to predict the survival following treatment of HNSCC.</text>

</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>80</offset>
<text>LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Identify clinical features of nonmelanoma skin cancer; 2. Distinguish low-risk versus high-risk basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma; 3. Define appropriate management based on current guidelines for various types of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. SUMMARY: Skin malignancies are the most prevalent cancers, and plastic surgeons are often the primary physicians engaged in diagnosis and management of these lesions. Proper management includes distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk lesions and determining treatment accordingly. The aim of this Continuing Medical Education article is to review the diagnosis and management of common and uncommon facial skin malignancies, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, keratoacanthoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, sebaceous carcinoma, and microcystic adnexal carcinoma.</text>

<offset>106</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The incidence of rare cutaneous malignancies is unknown. Current estimates of rare cutaneous malignancy incidences are based on broad epidemiologic data or single institution experiences, not population-based data. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of several rare nonmelanoma skin cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of a population-based cohort between the years 2000 and 2010. Residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who were diagnosed with a biopsy-proven nonmelanoma skin cancer-excluding basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma-were included in this study. The primary outcome was tumor incidence. Additionally, the authors extracted patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment modalities, and outcomes. RESULTS: The age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidences per 100,000 persons of multiple rare cutaneous malignancies were: atypical fibroxanthoma (1.8), sebaceous carcinoma (0.8), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (0.4), microcystic adnexal carcinoma (0.7), eccrine carcinoma (0.4), eccrine porocarcinoma (0.2), and leiomyosarcoma (0.2). CONCLUSION: The authors report population-based incidences and clinical characteristics for these rare cutaneous malignancies. The immune status and smoking status of patients and the treatment and outcomes of these tumors are reported. Additional studies in a broader population are needed to further define the epidemiology and outcomes of these malignancies.</text>

<text>Carcinogenesis of Vulvar Lesions: Morphology and Immunohistochemistry Evaluation.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>81</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the 2 pathways of vulvar carcinogenesis and correlate immunohistochemical expression of p53 with histopathological findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 76 cases. Patients were classified according to the 2004 International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease Terminology, followed by a review of clinical records and immunohistochemical staining for p53. RESULTS: Fifteen cases were in the human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated pathway (12 cases of usual vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia [VIN] and 3 of warty squamous cell carcinoma [SCC]), and 13 cases were in the HPV-independent pathway (5 cases of differentiated VIN and 8 of keratinizing SCC). Significant differences in p53 expression were observed between the 2 pathways of carcinogenesis: in the lesions related to the HPV-independent pathway, the percentage of p53-positive cells was greater (&gt;25%, p &lt; .001), and the staining pattern was basal (extending into the middle layer) in differentiated VIN and diffuse or infiltrative in warty SCC (p &lt; 0.001). In the lesions HPV-associated pathway, p53 staining was less extensive (&lt;= 10% of cells, p &lt; 0.001) and followed basal pattern in usual VIN, whereas warty SCCs were negative for p53 (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Unique patterns of histological appearance and p53 expression can separate vulvar lesions into 2 distinct pathways of carcinogenesis. We propose that p53 immunohistochemistry may be performed simultaneously with histopathological examination in all cases of VIN and vulvar SCC, because it would aid in definition of the pathway of carcinogenesis and thus enable better clinical follow-up of patients with these conditions.</text>

<text>Screening for cervical carcinoma in HIV-infected women: Analysis of main risk factors for cervical cytologic abnormalities.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>123</offset>
<text>AIM: The aim of this study was to identify potential predictive factors for cervical disease in women with HIV and to evaluate adherence during follow-up to cervical cancer screening. METHODS: In order to identify the independent role of factors associated with the presence of a cervical abnormality, all of the variables showing in univariate analyses a potential association with the outcome variable (presence of cervical abnormalities) were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model, along with age at first visit to our center, and age at diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 540 HIV-positive women who received screening for cervical cancer during the first year after their first visit to our center were included in the analysis; 423 (78.3%) had normal cytology and 117 (21.7%) had cytological abnormalities, classified as follows: 21 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (17.9%); 51 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (43.6%); 41 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (35.0%); and four cervical cancers (3.4%). In our study, women with more than two previous pregnancies were significantly associated with a lower risk of cervical cytological abnormalities compared to the other women. Women with CD4+ levels of 200-499/mm(3) had a higher risk of developing cervical cytological abnormalities compared to those with a CD4+ level  &gt;  500/ mm(3) . CONCLUSION: In summary, management of HIV-positive women must be modeled on HIV-clinical status, CD4+ cell count, drug regimen, and adherence to follow-up, relying on the cooperation of highly qualified professionals. In HIV-positive women, an adequate screening and follow-up allows for a reduced occurrence of advanced cervical disease and prevents recourse to invalidating surgical interventions.</text>

<text>Correlation of Ki-67 Proliferative Antigen Expression and Tumor Response to Induction Chemotherapy Containing Cell Cycle-Specific Agents in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>178</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Determine if highly proliferative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, assessed by pretreatment Ki-67 expression, respond more robustly to induction chemotherapy (IC) that is selectively toxic to cycling cells. Retrospective analysis of 59 patients treated with IC and chemoradiation. IC included either nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, 5-FU and cetuximab (APF-C, n   =   27) or docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-FU +/- cetuximab (TPF+/-C, n   =   32). Ki-67 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Tumor response (complete/partial/stable/progressive) at the primary site after two IC cycles was evaluated by visual examination in all patients. In the APF-C sub-group, tumor response (primary site and neck nodes) after two IC cycles was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT. Ki-67 expression (median 66%, range: 16-97) did not differ across the tumor response categories assessed by visual examination (p   =   0.95), CT (p   =   0.30), or FDG-PET/CT (p   =   0.65). Median decrease in summed SUVmax of measured lesions was 71.6% (range: 8.3-100%). The Pearson correlation coefficient between Ki-67 expression and the percent decrease in summed SUVmax was 0.48 (p   =   0.02). Ki-67 expression was not different between those with or without a relapse (median: 60 and 71%, p   =   0.10). In multivariate regression analysis (MVA) controlling for p16 positive oropharyngeal SCC status and smoking status, Ki-67 expression was not significantly associated with tumor response by visual examination (coefficient estimate -0.002, standard error 0.010, p   =   0.84), CT (coefficient estimate -0.007, standard error 0.011, p   =   0.54), FDG-PET/CT (coefficient estimate 0.006, standard error 0.008, p   =   0.51), the percent decrease in summed SUVmax (coefficient estimate 0.389, standard error 0.222, p   =   0.09), or relapse events (OR   =   1.02(95%CI:0.99-1.05), p   =   0.28). No significant relationships were found in MVA between pretreatment Ki-67 expression and tumor response to IC or to relapse.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a clinical challenge and identification of novel therapeutic targets is necessary. The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL has been implicated in several tumor entities and a selective AXL small molecule inhibitor (BGB324) is currently being tested in clinical trials for patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer or acute myeloid leukemia. Our study investigates AXL expression during HNSCC progression and its use as a potential therapeutic target in HNSCC. AXL protein expression was determined in a HNSCC cohort (n = 364) using immunohistochemical staining. For functional validation, AXL was either overexpressed or inhibited with BGB324 in HNSCC cell lines to assess proliferation, migration and invasion. We found AXL protein expression increasing during tumor progression with highest expression levels in recurrent tumors. In HNSCC cell lines in vitro, AXL overexpression increased migration as well as invasion. Both properties could be reduced through treatment with BGB324. In contrast, proliferation was neither affected by AXL overexpression nor by inhibition with BGB324. Our patient-derived data and in vitro results show that, in HNSCC, AXL is important for the progression to more advanced tumor stages. Moreover, they suggest that AXL could be a target for precision medicine approaches in this dismal tumor entity.</text>

<text>Platinum-Based Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage II and Stage III Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>100</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy (PBAC) for pathological stage II and stage III squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung was analyzed retrospectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prognoses of 94 patients with stage II and stage III SCC with or without PBAC (more than three courses of cisplatin-, carboplatin-, and nedaplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy) were compared. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 46.1 months. PBAC was not administered for the following reasons: 39 (55.7%) patients had comorbidities, 25 (35.7%) were older than 75 years, 19 (27.1%) patients underwent surgery before the approval of PBAC, and 3 (4.3%) patients could not continue PBAC (&lt;= 2 cycles) because of adverse events. PBAC patients (n = 24) were significantly younger than non-PBAC patients (n = 70; 66.3 vs 69.6 years old, respectively; p = 0.043). Disease-free survival (DFS) did not differ between PBAC and non-PBAC patients (55.0% and 67.1%, respectively; p = 0.266). PBAC patients tended to have worse overall survival (OS) than non-PBAC patients (56.1% and 70.2%, respectively; p = 0.138). PBAC was not prognostic for OS (hazard ratio (HR), 2.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82%-5.40%; p = 0.120). CONCLUSION: PBAC did not improve the prognoses of patients with pathological stage II or stage III SCC in the single institution experience.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The aim of this study was to assess TERT-CLPTM1L single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs402710 C/T in the CLPTM1L gene; rs2736100 A/C and rs2736098 G/A in the TERT gene) as risk factors for development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and to investigate the relationship between the analyzed polymorphisms, relative telomere length (RTL), telomerase expression and clinicopathologic characteristics of OSCC in a Serbian population. Paraffin-embedded tumor samples and buccal swabs from cancer-free controls were genotyped using PCR-RFLP, while tumor RTL values and telomerase expression were estimated by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. CLPTM1L rs402710 and TERT rs2736100 polymorphisms were associated with a significantly increased risk of OSCC, and TERT rs2736098 with a significantly decreased risk. No significant association was found between TERT-CLPTM1L polymorphisms, tumor RTL values, telomerase expression, and clinicopathologic features, although a trend towards longer telomeres was evident in telomerase-positive samples and less advanced tumors. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with longer telomeres in their tumors had significantly better overall survival than patients with shorter telomeres. Our research seems to provide strong evidence for an association between CLPTM1L rs402710C/T and TERT rs2736100A/C SNPs and the risk of OSSC, and suggests that higher tumor RTL values and positive hTERT expression may be applicable as early prognostic markers.(J Oral Sci 58, 449-458, 2016).</text>

<text>Virus and Host Events in Squamous Carcinogenesis.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>49</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Our group investigates early and late stages in the development of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), in order to identify new approaches to diagnosis and therapy. The principal themes are:1. Transcriptional deregulation of high-risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV)We study mechanisms of HRHPV transcriptional deregulation and competitive cell selection during SCC progression, focussing on the causes and effects of integration of HPV16 into the host genome. We showed that HPV16 integration does not necessarily lead to a competitive growth advantage or increased levels of virus oncogenes. Selection of individual cells is determined through multiple layers of epigenetic regulation of the integrated virus genome. We are currently studying whether the epigenetic landscape of integrated HPV16 reflects that of the host genome at the integration site and/or sites of long-range chromatin interactions of the virus DNA. This work may ultimately identify targets for epigenetic therapies in SCCs containing integrated HRHPV.2. The oncostatin-M receptor (OSMR) in metastasisThe cell-surface oncostatin-M receptor (OSMR) has emerged as an exciting therapeutic target in SCCs. Both copy number gain and over-expression of OSMR have a strong adverse prognostic effect in SCCs. Carcinoma cells that over-expressed OSMR were more sensitive to the major ligand OSM, which induced multiple pro-malignant effects, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, increased metastasis and the ability to induce pro-malignant changes in cells from the tumour microenvironment (TME). We are now studying the effectiveness of OSM:OSMR blockade on the growth and metastasis of SCC cells in vivo, as well as effects on the TME in immunocompetent hosts.(Presented at the 1923th Meeting, August 10, 2016).</text>

<text>Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators increase sensitivity to cisplatin in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>119</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive and often fatal disease. Cisplatin is the most common chemotherapeutic drug in the treatment of HNSCC, but intrinsic and acquired resistance are frequent, and severe side effects occur at high doses. The second messenger cyclic GMP (cGMP) is produced by soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). We previously reported that activation of the cGMP signaling cascade caused apoptosis in HNSCC cells, while others found that this pathway enhances cisplatin efficacy in some cell types. Here we found that sGC stimulators reduced HNSCC cell viability synergistically with cisplatin, and enhanced apoptosis by cisplatin. Moreover, the sGC stimulators effectively reduced viability in cells with acquired cisplatin resistance, and were synergistic with cisplatin. The sGC stimulator BAY 41-2272 reduced expression of the survival proteins EGFR and b-catenin, and increased pro-apoptotic Bax, suggesting a potential mechanism for the anti-tumorigenic effects of these drugs. The sGC stimulator Riociguat is FDA-approved to treat pulmonary hypertension, and others are being studied for therapeutic use in several diseases. These drugs could provide valuable addition or alternative to cisplatin in the treatment of HNSCC.</text>

<text>Leukocytosis and neutrophilia predicts outcome in anal cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>62</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: Leukocytosis and neutrophilia could be the tip of the iceberg in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. We aimed to validate their prognostic significance in a cohort of patients treated with definitive chemoradiation for anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). MATERIALS _ METHODS: Clinical records from all consecutive patients treated in a single institution between 2006 and 2016 with curative-intent radiotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia, defined as leukocyte or neutrophil count over 10,000 and 7500/mm(3), respectively, were studied in terms of overall survival (OS), progression (PFS), locoregional (LFS) and distant (DFS)-free survival. RESULTS: We identified 103 non-metastatic HIV-negative patients, with concurrent chemotherapy use in 78%. Twelve and 8% displayed baseline leukocytosis and neutrophilia, respectively. Estimated 3-year OS and PFS were 88% and 67%, respectively. In univariate analysis, both leukocytosis and neutrophilia were strongly associated with inferior OS, PFS, LFS and DFS (p&lt;0.01). In multivariate analysis, leukocytosis and neutrophilia remained strongly associated with patient outcome (p&lt;0.01), independently from tumor T and N-stage. Anemia was an independent predictor of worse OS and PFS, while chemoradiation overall treatment time below 50days improved PFS. CONCLUSION: Leukocytosis and neutrophilia are strong prognostic factors for OS, PFS, LFS and DFS in anal cancer treated with chemoradiation. These biomarkers could help identify patients with higher risk of tumor relapse that require treatment intensification.</text>

<text>Defining the boundaries and expanding the utility of head and neck cancer patient derived xenografts.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>101</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Patient derived xenografts (PDXs) represent an essential tool in oncologic research, and we sought to further expand our repertoire of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) while determining potential boundaries for this system. METHODS: We consented new patients for PDX development and determined if a 24-h time delay from tumor excision to xenograft implantation affected PDX establishment. We developed a tissue microarray (TMA) from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded PDXs and their subsequent passages and carried out quantitative immunohistochemistry for EGFR, pEGFR, pAkt, pERK and ERCC1. First and last passaged PDXs were compared via a paired t-test to examine for the stability of protein expression across passages. We performed a similar comparison of the mutational profile of the patient tumor and resulting xenografts using a targeted sequencing approach. RESULTS: No patient/tumor characteristics influenced PDX take rate and the 24-h time delay from tumor excision to xenograft implantation did not affect PDX establishment, growth or histology. There was no significant difference in biomarker expression between the first and last passaged PDXs for EGFR, pEGFR, pAkt, and ERCC1. For pERK there was a significant difference (p=0.002), but further analysis demonstrated this only arose in three of 15 PDXs. Targeted sequencing revealed striking stability of passenger and likely driver mutations from patient to xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: The stability of protein expression across PDX passages will hopefully allow greater investigation of predictive biomarkers in order to identify ones for further pre-clinical and clinical investigation.</text>

<text>Healthy life expectancy of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients aged 75years and older.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>88</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: Healthy life expectancy, an extension of the concept of life expectancy, is a summary measure of population health that takes into account the mortality and morbidity of a population. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively analyze the self-reliance survival times of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twelve patients aged 75years or older with primary OSCC were included and examined at Shinshu University Hospital. To investigate healthy life expectancy, OSCC patients older than 75years were divided into 3 groups: 75-79, 80-84, and older than 85years. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the median times of healthy life expectancy. The Log-rank test was used to test significant differences between actual curves. RESULTS: The median self-reliance survival times of patients aged 75-79, 80-84, and older than 85years were 5.7, 1.6, and 1.4years, respectively. Most patients with early stage cancers underwent curative treatments and showed a health expectancy of more than 5years. In patients with advanced cancers, health expectancy was poor (less than one year), except among patients aged 75-79years who underwent standard treatments. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that in patients with advanced cancers, health expectancy was poor (less than 1year), except among patients aged 75-79years who underwent standard treatments. In elderly patients, healthy life expectancy (self-reliance survival time) may be one of the measures of patient prognosis as well as overall survival times.</text>

<text>A comprehensive analysis of clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients harboring a MET exon 14 skipping mutation compared to other driver mutations in an East Asian population.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>175</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: Recurrent somatic splice-site alterations at MET exon 14 (MET(  14)), which result in exon skipping and MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) activation, have been characterised. However, their demographic features and clinical outcomes in East Asian lung cancer patients have yet to be determined. METHODS: A one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using RNA samples from 850 East Asian lung cancer patients, was performed in order to detect MET(  14) and five other major driver mutations, including those in the EGFR, KRAS, ALK, HER2, and ROS1 genes. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to confirm the overexpression of MET in patients harbouring the MET(  14) mutation. We analysed the demographic data and clinical outcomes of MET(  14) mutation positive lung cancer patients and compared them to those of MET(  14) mutation negative lung cancer patients. RESULTS: In total, 27 lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients and 1 squamous cell carcinoma patient with the MET(  14) mutation were identified. The overall incidence was 3.3% for lung cancer and 4.0% for lung ADC. IHC demonstrated that the majority of lung cancer patients harboring a MET(  14) mutation exhibited a strong cytoplasmic expression of MET. MET(  14) mutation positive patients were generally quite elderly individuals. Stage IV MET(  14) mutation positive lung cancer patients receiving no specific anti-MET therapy were observed to have a similar overall survival (OS) compared to patients in the all negative group (P&gt;0.05). In the multivariate analysis, mutation status was found not to be a major risk factor for OS in lung cancer patients without appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The OS of MET(  14) mutation positive lung cancer patients is comparable to that of the major driver gene mutation negative lung cancer patients.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVES: Mutation in the PIK3CA gene is reported frequent in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, but its potential prognostic role is still obscure. We have studied the prognostic importance of PIK3CA mutations as well as the relation to other markers in a large number of early stage lung cancers of squamous carcinoma subtype. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumour tissue was obtained from 308 consecutively operated lung cancer patients with squamous cell carcinoma in the period 2003-2013. DNA was isolated according to standard procedures, and mutation analysis was done with either the SnapShot method and/or using PIK3CA specific primers in the Cobas system. PD-L1-expression was analysed with immunohistochemistry After thorough follow-up (median 67.6 months), overall survival and time to relapse was calculated. RESULTS: Tumour tissue from 102 females and 206 males were analysed. 167 (54.2%) were in stage I, 96 (31.2%) in stage II and 45 (14.6%) in stage III. PIK3CA mutation was found in 35 (11.4%) patients, most frequently in exon 20. There were no differences in sex, stage or smoking behaviour between mutated and non-mutated cases. Patients with PIK3CA mutations had a significantly longer overall survival (p=0.042) and time to relapse (p=0.030) than non-mutated cases, and the difference in time to relapse was also retained in stage I-cases (p=0.044). PD-L1-expression was less frequent among mutated cases. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that PIK3CA mutations may confer a survival advantage in early stage squamous cell lung cancers, but further work is needed to confirm this finding.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors and the prognosis of patients remains poor. Increasing evidence suggests that nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT1) plays an important role in the development and progression of cancers. Herein, we show that NFAT1 was overexpressed in human ESCC, which was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. Functional studies found that NFAT1 silencing could suppress cell migration and invasion through MMP-3. The data therefore suggest that NFAT1 plays an important adverse role in the development and progression of ESCC, implicating possible application in clinics as a biomarker and a potential new therapeutic target.</text>

<offset>93</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Urogenital schistosomiasis is a chronic infection caused by the human blood fluke Schistosoma haematobium. Schistosomiasis haematobium is a known risk factor for cancer leading to squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (SCC). This is a neglected tropical disease endemic in many countries of Africa and the Middle East. Schistosome eggs produce catechol-estrogens. These molecules are metabolized to active quinones that cause alterations in DNA (leading in other contexts to breast or thyroid cancer). Our group have shown that schistosome egg associated catechol estrogens induce tumor-like phenotypes in urothelial cells, originated from parasite estrogen-host cell chromosomal DNA adducts and mutations. Here we review recent findings on the role of estrogen-DNA adducts and how their shedding in urine may be prognostic of schistosome infection and/or represent potential biomarkers for urogenital schistosomiasis associated bladder cancer and infertility.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Zrt-Irt-like protein 4 (ZIP4) is critical molecule for proper mammalian development and releasing zinc from vesicular compartments. Recent studies suggested that ZIP4 plays an important role of tumor progression in pancreatic, prostate, and hepatocellular cancers, however, little is known about the detail mechanism of ZIP4 in their cancers. In the present study, we examined the possibility of ZIP4 as a new molecular target for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We evaluated ZIP4 expression in OSCC-derived cell lines and primary OSCC samples by quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We also analyzed the clinical correlation between ZIP4 status and clinical behaviors in patients with OSCC. In addition, ZIP4 knockdown cells (shZIP4 cells) and ZnCl2 treatment were used for functional experiments, including cellular proliferation assay, zinc uptake assay, and cell-cycle analysis. ZIP4 mRNA and protein were up-regulated significantly in OSCCs compared with normal counterparts in vitro and in vivo. IHC showed that ZIP4 expression in the primary OSCC was positively correlated with primary tumoral size. The shZIP4 cells showed decrease accumulation of intercellular zinc and decreased cellular growth by cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase, resulting from up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and down-regulation of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Since cellular growth of OSCC cells after treatment with zinc was significantly greater than control cells, we speculated that intercellular ZnCl2 accumulation is an important factor for cellular growth. Consistent with our hypothesis, not only decreased zinc uptake by ZIP4 knockdown but also chelating agent, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), showed inhibitory effects of cellular proliferation. Therefore, our data provide evidence for an essential role of ZIP4 and intracellular zinc for tumoral growth in OSCC, suggesting that zinc uptake might be a potential therapeutic targeting event for OSCCs.</text>

<text>A Histologic Basis for the Efficacy of SBRT to the lung.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>56</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the standard of care for medically inoperable patients with early-stage NSCLC. However, NSCLC is composed of several histological subtypes and the impact of this heterogeneity on SBRT treatments has yet to be established. METHODS: We analyzed 740 patients with early-stage NSCLC treated definitively with SBRT from 2003 through 2015. We calculated cumulative incidence curves using the competing risk method and identified predictors of local failure using Fine and Gray regression. RESULTS: Overall, 72 patients had a local failure, with a cumulative incidence of local failure at 3 years of 11.8%. On univariate analysis, squamous histological subtype, younger age, fewer medical comorbidities, higher body mass index, higher positron emission tomography standardized uptake value, central tumors, and lower radiation dose were associated with an increased risk for local failure. On multivariable analysis, squamous histological subtype (hazard ratio  = 2.4 p  = 0.008) was the strongest predictor of local failure. Patients with squamous cancers fail SBRT at a significantly higher rate than do those with adenocarcinomas or NSCLC not otherwise specified, with 3-year cumulative rates of local failure of 18.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.7-25.1), 8.7% (95% CI: 4.6-12.8), and 4.1% (95% CI: 0-9.6), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate an increased rate of local failure in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Standard approaches for radiotherapy that demonstrate efficacy for a population may not achieve optimal results for individual patients. Establishing the differential dose effect of SBRT across histological groups is likely to improve efficacy and inform ongoing and future studies that aim to expand indications for SBRT.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common solid tumor in the oral cavity. Development and progression of OSCC is associated with the elevated presence of inhibitory M2 type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). However, the underlying mechanism leading to the enrichment of M2 TAMs and the pathway through which TAMs foster tumor progression are still unclear. In this study, we harvested TAMs and tumor cells from primary OSCC resections of stage II and stage III patients. We showed that compared to peritumoral macrophages, TAMs presented upregulated expression of PD-L1 and elevated capacity in inducing T cell apoptosis. The level of PD-L1 expression directly correlated with the level of T cell apoptosis. Interestingly, peripheral blood monocytes with low initial PD-L1 level had upregulated PD-L1 expression and acquired the ability to induce T cell apoptosis, after incubation with primary tumor cells from OSCC patients. The PD-L1 expression by monocytes depended on interleukin 10 (IL-10), since blockade of IL-10 in the tumor-monocyte coculture abrogated PD-L1 upregulation. IL-10 mRNA expression in tumor cells and monocytes also preceded PD-L1 mRNA expression in monocytes. Furthermore, the IL-10 concentration in the tumor microenvironment directly correlated with the PD-L1 level on TAMs. Together, these results suggest that OSCC could directly suppress antitumor T cell immunity through conditioning TAMs.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a malignant proliferation of keratinocytes with an uncertain molecular basis causing significant morbidity. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression on post- transcriptional level. MiRs are critical to various biological processes. To determine if miRs play a role in pathogenesis of invasive cSCC, we collected patients' specimens from in situ and invasive cSCC (n  =  19) and examined miRs expression levels using qPCR. Specifically, we evaluated miR-21, miR-103a, miR-186, miR-200b, miR-203, and miR-205 expression levels due to their role in skin biology and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. MiR levels were compared between in situ and invasive cSCCs. We found statistically significant (p  &lt;=   0.05) upregulation of miR-21 and miR-205 in invasive cSCC compared to cSCC in situ. We concluded that miR-21 and miR-205 may have diagnostic value in determining the invasive properties of cSCCs and that each cSCC displays unique miR profile, underscoring the possibility of personalized medicine approach in developing potential novel, less invasive treatments.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVES: Relapse is the most serious problem affecting the morbidity and mortality rates of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Although HNSCC has been studied for several decades, the exact mechanism of cancer recurrence remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ataxia-telangiectasia mutated interactor (ATMIN) messenger RNA(mRNA) expression was detected in HNSCC samples by quantitative RT-PCR, and was analyzed with patients' clinical outcomes by Kaplan-Meier analyses. The ectopic ATMIN expression or ATMIN silencing on invasion ability was evaluated in HNSCC cell lines. Lymph node metastasis ability was investigated by buccal orthotopic implantation in vivo. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: ATMIN mRNA expression was positively correlated with patients' clinical outcomes. ATMIN blockage reduced invasion, migration, and metastasis abilities both in vitro and in vivo. Evidence from a buccal orthotopic implantation mice model showed that silenced ATMIN expression prolongs mice survival and reduced lymph node metastasis. In high-throughput microarray and bioinformative analyses, KRas was identified as a crucial downstream effector in ATMIN-mediated HNSCC metastasis and was positively associated with patients' clinical stages and ATMIN mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: The role of ATMIN and its regulatory mechanisms in HNSCC progression are reported for the first time. The study results improve our understanding of the ATMIN-KRas axis leading to HNSCC migration or invasion and metastasis and facilitates the identification of possible therapy targets of downstream genes for designing effective therapeutic strategies in personalized medicine.</text>

<text>Systematic review and individual patient data analysis of pediatric head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: An analysis of 217 cases.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>132</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: Pediatric head and neck Squamous cell carcinoma (PHNSCC) is a rare disease. The optimum treatment and outcome remains poorly understood because of rarity. METHODS: We conducted an individual patient data analysis of PHNSCC. Two authors independently searched PubMed, google search, and Cochrane library for eligible studies using following search words: Pediatric Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma under age of 20, Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in young, PHNSCC till June 1, 2016 published in English language. RESULTS: Total of 217 patients of PHNSCC were found in the literature. Median age among the cohort was 15 years (Range: 0-20 years) with a clear male preponderance. Oral cavity tumors were commonest 75 (70%) followed by laryngeal neoplasms 16(15%). Median disease free survival was 9 months (Range: 0-216 months). Median overall survival was 48 months (Range: 1-216 months). In univariate analysis treatment modality had significant impact on disease free survival (DFS). Whereas, patients treated with Surgery, Laryngeal primary had significantly better OS. Patients with associated fanconis anemia had significantly worse overall survival (OS). CONCLUSION: PHNSCC is a rare disease with poorer outcome. Associated DNA defects leads to poorer OS. Patients treated with surgery alone or surgery followed by adjuvant radiation had better DFS and OS. Molecular profiling and personalized therapy may improve survival with limited toxicity.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Melanoma is a rare type of skin cancer with a high mortality rate. Local invasion and metastatic spread are primarily responsible for the morbidity and mortality of melanoma. While metastatic lesions vary from cystic to solid, cystic metastases can be challenging to diagnose. Up to date, there are only a few published studies that describe cystic metastases in melanoma and other conditions such as lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma and thyroid papillary carcinoma. We describe a case of cystic metastatic axillary lymph nodes in a patient with subungual acral lentiginous melanoma and the challenges to reaching an accurate diagnosis.</text>

<text>Anal verrucous carcinoma is not related to infection with human papillomaviruses and should be distinguished from giant condyloma (Buschke-L  wenstein tumor).</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>158</offset>
<text>AIMS: Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is a variant of well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and is in the anal region regarded as synonymous with giant condyloma (Buschke-L  wenstein tumor) (BLT). Etiology, diagnostic criteria and clinical behavior of both lesions are controversial. Recent studies suggest that VC at other sites is not associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV). We hypothesized that anal VC is also not related to HPV, while BLT is a HPV-induced lesion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten cases of VC and 4 cases of BLT were included. Several techniques were used for HPV detection: in situ hybridization for HPV6, 11, 16 and 18, six different PCR protocols for detection of at least 89 HPV types from Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Mu-PV genera, and in situ hybridization for high risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA. p16 immunohistochemistry and morphometric analysis were also performed. Alpha-, Gamma- and Mu-PVs were not found in any case of VC, while HPV6 was detected in all cases of BLT. p16 overexpression was not present in any of the lesions. Among microscopic features, only the absence of koilocytosis and enlarged spinous cells seem to be useful to distinguish VC from BLT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that anal VC, similarly to VC at other sites, is not associated with HPV infection and must be distinguished from BLT which is associated with low risk HPV. Only with well-set diagnostic criteria will it be possible to ascertain clinical behavior and optimal treatment for both lesions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</text>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>60</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Dermoscopy of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has already been described. However little is known on the dermoscopic features of lip SCC. OBJECTIVES: to describe the clinic and dermoscopic criteria of lip SCC, METHODS: Clinical and dermoscopic images of lip SCC were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of specific dermoscopic criteria. Cases were collected from Skin Cancer Unit of Reggio Emilia, Italy, Dermatology Unit Second University of Naples, Italy, and First Department of Dermatology of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. RESULTS: We collected 22 lip SCC; the majority were located on the lower lip (90.9%); more than 2/3 of the total series were flat (68.2%). The clinical images revealed that white-yellowish and red colours were almost equally presented and usually combined together. The predominant clinical aspect that characterized lip SCC was the presence of ulceration (90.9%). Dermoscopically, we noticed polymorphous unfocused small size vessels located both peripheral or throughout the lesions. Scales and white structures were observed in all lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of ulceration, scales, polymorphous vessels and white structures are the main dermoscopic features of lip SCC. This article is protected by copyright.

<text>BACKGROUND: Organ transplant recipients have a highly increased risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Sensation of pain in cutaneous tumours is a powerful patient-reported warning signal for invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in organ transplant recipients. OBJECTIVES: The impact of painful compared to painless skin lesions and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to other skin lesions on the overall mortality risk in organ transplant recipients (OTR) was investigated. METHODS: We followed 410 OTR from 10 different centres across Europe and North America during the period between 2008 and 2015. These patients had been enrolled in an earlier study to define clinically meaningful patient-reported warning signals predicting the presence of SCC and had been included if they had a lesion requiring histological diagnosis. Cumulative incidences of overall mortality were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and risk factors were analysed with Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS: There was an increased overall mortality risk in OTR who reported painful compared to painless skin lesions with a hazard ratio adjusted for age, sex, and other relevant factors of 1.6 (95% CI 0.97-2.7). There was also an increased overall mortality risk in OTR diagnosed with SCC compared to other skin lesions with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.7 (95% CI 1.0-2.8). Mortality due to internal malignancies and systemic infections appeared to prevail in OTR with SCC. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that OTR have an increased overall mortality risk if they develop painful skin lesions or are diagnosed with cutaneous SCC. This article is protected by copyright.

<text>BACKGROUND/AIM: Podoplanin is a candidate cancer stem cell marker in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Several studies have reported the prognostic value of podoplanin expression in tumor cells in lung SCC but few have focused on its expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic significance of podoplanin expression, with special reference to the expression pattern in both tumor cells and CAFs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical analyses using anti-podoplanin antibody were performed on 126 resected specimens of lung SCC. When more than 10% of tumor cells or CAFs showed immunoreactivity with podoplanin levels as strong as those of the positive controls, the specimens were classified as a podoplanin-positive. RESULTS: Podoplanin-positive status in tumor cells (n=54) was correlated with a lower incidence of lymphatic invasion (p=0.031) but there were no significant differences in disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) by the log-rank test. Podoplanin-positive status in CAFs (n=41) was correlated with more advanced stage (p=0.008), higher frequency of pleural invasion (p=0.002) and both shorter DFS (p=0.006) and DSS (p=0.006). In Cox's multivariate analysis, podoplanin-positive status in CAFs was an independent negative prognostic factor for DFS (p=0.027) and DSS (p=0.027). CONCLUSION: Podoplanin expression in CAFs might be an independent unfavorable prognostic indicator in patients with lung SCC, irrespective of the expression status of tumor cells.</text>

<text>Detection of Circulating Tumour Cells and Survival of Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>95</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Detection of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of lung cancer patients may predict survival. Various platforms exist that allow capture of these cells for further analysis; little work however, has been done with the ScreenCell device, an antibody-independent CTC platform. The aim of our study was to evaluate the ScreenCell device for detection of CTCs in lung cancer patients and to establish correlations of these findings with survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients, nine males, and fourteen females, underwent surgical treatment from February to May 2014 for non-small cell lung cancer. Thirteen patients had adenocarcinoma and ten squamous cell carcinoma, while eight were at an early stage (I-II) and five at a later stage (III-IV). Blood samples were obtained prior to surgery and following filtration through the ScreenCell device, were independently reviewed by 2 consultant pathologists. RESULTS: The pathologists were able to independently identify CTCs in 78.3% (N=18) and 73.9% (N=17) of the cases examined, with overall 80.6% in early stages compared to 60.0% in late stages. The median survival times of positive vs. negative for CTC patients were 1011 and 711 days respectively, with a survival percentage rate of 77.8% and 60% in positive and negative CTC cohorts respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the presence of CTCs analyzed by ScreenCell did not necessarily lead to a poorer prognosis in patients with lung cancer after curative surgery.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are common types of human cancer. Spheroid colony formation is used to characterize cancer stem cell (CSCs). In the present study, we analyzed the significance of kinesin family 11 (KIF11 in human ESCC and CRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of KIF11 in 105 ESCC and 100 CRC cases was determined using immunohistochemistry. RNA interference was used to inhibit KIF11 expression in ESCC and CRC cell lines. RESULTS: In total, 61 out of 105 (58%) ESCC and 62 out of 100 (62%) CRC cases were positive for KIF11. Expression of KIF11 was not associated with any clinicopathological characteristics. Both the number and size of spheres produced by from TE-5 ESCC cells and DLD-1 CRC cells were significantly reduced upon KIF11 siRNA transfection compared to negative control siRNA transfection. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that KIF11 plays an important role in CSCs of ESCC and CRC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Inflammation and the immune system play a role in the development and progression of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The pro-inflammatory and tumor-promoting effects of the high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) protein and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) have been investigated in these cutaneous malignancies. The clinical implication of these molecules is not fully described. The National Library of Medicine database was searched for articles addressing the clinical relevance of HMGB1 and RAGE in melanoma, BCC, and SCC. This systematic review includes nine articles, with six summarizing RAGE in cutaneous malignancies and three involving HMGB1. RAGE has been found to be up-regulated in SCC lesions, as well as melanoma. Levels of RAGE were highest in stage IV melanomas. Lower levels of soluble RAGE have been associated with poor overall survival in melanoma. Sporadic extracellular expression of HMGB1 was evident in BCC and SCC lesions, which could be released by necrotic tumor cells. HMGB1 was found to be a prognostic marker in melanoma, and HMGB1 levels were elevated in patients who were non-responders to ipilimumab treatment. HMGB1 and RAGE could serve as potential prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in treating melanoma, BCC, and SCC, but further research regarding the clinical utility of the HMGB1-RAGE axis in cutaneous malignancies is warranted.</text>

<text>Preoperative Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Predicts the Prognosis of  Oral  Squamous Cell Carcinoma:  A  Large-Sample Prospective  Study.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>138</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: To assess and determine the prognostic value of the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective study involving 1,202 patients with OSCC and surgical resection was carried out in Fujian, China. Two-stage analyses were performed by randomly dividing all patients into 800 discovery and 402 replication sets. The optimal NLR cutoff points were identified by the X-tile program with minimum P values. Prognostic factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. RESULTS: The discovery set was categorized as low-, middle-, and high-risk groups based on optimal NLR cutoff points (&lt;1.94, 1.94 to 3.66, and &gt;3.66, respectively). A high NLR was meaningfully associated with an increased risk of death on survival (NLR 1.99 to 3.66, hazard ratio [HR]  = 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.08; NLR &gt;3.66, HR  = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.21-2.55). In the replication phase, patients with a high NLR showed considerably worse overall survival compared with those with a low NLR (NLR 1.94 to 3.66, HR  = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.02-2.55; NLR &gt;3.66, HR  = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.16-3.27). In addition, better overall survival was observed for patients with a higher NLR who had received postoperative chemoradiotherapy (HR  = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26-0.92). CONCLUSION: The preoperative NLR is an independent factor in predicting the prognosis of OSCC, especially for patients with chemoradiotherapy, which could serve as a potential target for improving patients' prognosis.</text>

<text>Influence of bone invasion on outcomes after marginal mandibulectomy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>115</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: Marginal mandibulectomy (MM) is indicated for oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas (OCSCC) that abut or minimally erode the mandible without gross invasion. Successful implementation of MM is predicated on accurate patient selection and appropriate adjuvant treatment based on well-known host and tumor characteristics. The incidence of microscopically diagnosed bone involvement in MM specimens and its implications on outcomes have however not been reported in large contemporary series. PURPOSE: To report the incidence of bone involvement and analyze its influence on oncologic outcomes in selected patients who underwent MM in treatment of OCSCC. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was performed on a consecutive series of previously untreated patients requiring MM, at a tertiary care cancer center, between 1985 and 2012 (n  =  326). The median age was 64 years and 59% were male. The majority of patients (67%) had a primary tumor of the floor of the mouth or lower alveolus, 80% were clinically staged T1-2, and 31% were clinically N+. Postoperative radiation (PORT) was used in 27% and chemoradiation (POCTRT) in 8% of patients who had microscopic bone invasion. The median follow up period was 55 months and endpoints of interest were local and regional recurrence free (LRFS and RRFS) and disease specific (DSS) survival. RESULTS: Microscopic bone invasion was present in 15% of patients (n  =  49). Among these, cortical invasion was present in 32, medullary in 13, and it was not specified in 4. Eight patients had microscopic positive bone margins. Positive bone margins were associated with medullary bone involvement (p  &lt;  0.001), floor of mouth and buccal mucosa primary site (p  =  0.03), and positive soft tissue margins (p  =  0.06). LRFS and DSS were similar in patients without versus with bone invasion (62.8% vs 79.7% and 76.2% vs 66% respectively, p  =  NS). LRFS were similar in patients with microscopic positive versus negative bone margins, as long as postoperative adjuvant treatment was administered. CONCLUSION: Microscopic bone involvement does not adversely influence outcomes but medullary bone involvement does confer a higher risk of positive bone margins. MM and appropriate adjuvant treatment is an effective strategy for treatment of OCSCC in selected patients with primary tumors adherent to or in proximity to the mandible.</text>

<text>Islanded facial artery musculomucosal flap for tongue reconstruction.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>69</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Reconstruction of the tongue can be achieved by means of various local, regional, and microvascular free flaps. Local flaps commonly used for tongue reconstruction include the nasolabial flap, submental flap, infrahyoid flap, and pedicled facial artery musculomucosal (FAMM) flap. The purpose of this article is to propose a technical modification to the FAMM flap for the reconstruction of small to medium-sized tongue defects post tumour excision: islanding the flap and tunnelling it from the lingual aspect of the mandible in a single-stage procedure. Islanding of the FAMM flap was found to be an extremely useful modification, giving excellent range of movement for the flap and eliminating the need for revision in a second stage procedure.</text>

<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>77</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: Is the use of harmonic scalpel for neck dissection useful? Literature search did not show a single, prospective, randomised control trial. We intended to study the role of harmonic scalpel in neck dissection and compare it with conventional electrocautery technique for oral cavity carcinoma. METHODS: 40 patients undergoing selective neck dissection for primary oral cavity malignancy were enrolled in this study. The harmonic scalpel (HS) group consisted of 20 patients, and the electrocautery technique (ET) group comprised of 20 patients. The following variables were examined: intraoperative blood loss, operative time, number of ligatures used, postoperative drain, and postoperative hospital stay. RESULTS: Intraoperative blood loss was found to be significantly reduced in harmonic scalpel group as compared to electrocautery group. However, we found no difference in other parameters like operative time, postop drain, postoperative hospital stay and number of ligatures used between both groups. CONCLUSION: Harmonic scalpel for neck dissection is associated with significantly lesser intraoperative blood loss as compared to electrocautery. There is no effect on operative time and postoperative hospital stay in both groups.</text>

<text>New perspectives in the second-line treatment of non squamous NSCLC patients: Results from a large Italian Lung Cancer Working Group.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>133</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Lung cancer is still considered a big killer among cancer diseases, due to high incidence and mortality rates. The newer frontiers of therapeutic development regard the discovery of oncogene driven tumours: however, the majority of NSCLC patients are wild type and they cannot be treated with targeted based agents. The recent positive results obtained with immunotherapy and with the combination of angiogenesis inhibitors and docetaxel, changed the therapeutic scenario of the second line therapy of non squamous NSCLC without actionable mutations. A major issue is currently the lack of predictive biomarkers that could help the oncologists in the choice of the best second-line treatment. Aim of this project was to define an optimal therapeutic pathway for patients with non-squamous NSCLC, through a working group of a large number of Italian lung cancer oncologists. Panellists have identified and discussed the more significant criteria in the second-line setting for a therapeutic decision between the combination of angiogenesis inhibitors plus chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Finally, they expressed their preference on each criterion, building a proposal of a decision-making tree for a second-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC.</text>

<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>50</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: This review examines the etiology and pathogenesis of idiopathic achalasia. This disease is clinically characterized by dysphagia of solids and liquids due to the presence of simultaneous or absent esophageal contractions and impaired or absent relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. It includes a review of (a) etiology and pathogenesis of this inflammatory process that damage the ganglion cells of the Auerbach plexus that is limited to the esophagus; (b) genetic abnormalities and polymorphisms associated with this disease that may help explain its heterogeneity expressed by the different motility abnormalities of its phenotypes as well as differences in its clinical progression. These different genetic abnormalities may be responsible for the slow progression of types I or II phenotypes; (c) indirect evidence of viruses present in these patients that may initiate its development; (d) the abnormalities of the muscle layer that may be responsible for the dilation of the body of the esophagus that ultimately causes the sigmoid-like esophagus in the very last phase of this disease. This progression to the end-stage phase tends to occur in about 5% of patients. And, (e) the chronic inflammatory abnormalities in the squamous mucosa that may be the cause of the dysplastic and neoplastic changes that may lead to squamous cell carcinoma whose incidence in this disease is increased. These mucosal abnormalities are usually present in patients with markedly dilated body of the esophagus and severe food stasis.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Pseudomyogenic (epithelioid sarcoma-like) hemangioendothelioma is a distinctive vascular neoplasm of intermediate biological potential with a predilection for young adults and frequent multifocal presentation. Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is characterized by loose fascicles of plump spindled and epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and coexpression of keratins and endothelial markers. Recently, a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion has been identified as a consistent genetic alteration in pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma. FOSB gene fusions have also been reported in a subset of epithelioid hemangiomas. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential diagnostic utility of FOSB immunohistochemistry for pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma compared with other endothelial neoplasms and histologic mimics. We evaluated whole-tissue sections from 274 cases including 50 pseudomyogenic hemangioendotheliomas, 84 other vascular tumors (24 epithelioid hemangiomas [including 6 cases with angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia histology], 20 epithelioid angiosarcomas, 20 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas [17 CAMTA1 positive, 2 TFE3 positive], 10 spindle-cell angiosarcomas, and 10 epithelioid angiomatous nodules), and 140 other histologic mimics (20 each epithelioid sarcoma, proliferative fasciitis, nodular fasciitis, cellular benign fibrous histiocytoma, spindle-cell squamous cell carcinoma, spindle-cell rhabdomyosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma). Immunohistochemistry for FOSB was performed following pressure cooker antigen retrieval using a rabbit monoclonal antibody. Diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity for FOSB (&gt;50% of cells) was observed in 48 of 50 (96%) pseudomyogenic hemangioendotheliomas and 13 of 24 (54%) epithelioid hemangiomas (including all angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia type). Both FOSB-negative pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma cases were decalcified bone tumors. Only 7 other tumors showed diffuse FOSB expression: 2 proliferative fasciitis, 2 nodular fasciitis, 1 epithelioid angiosarcoma, 1 spindle-cell angiosarcoma, and 1 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Of note, the FOSB-positive epithelioid hemangioendothelioma was negative for CAMTA1 and TFE3. Focal weak FOSB staining was observed in a subset of histologic mimics and is therefore not diagnostically meaningful. In conclusion, FOSB is a highly sensitive and diagnostically useful marker for pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma. Immunohistochemistry for FOSB may be helpful to distinguish pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma from histologic mimics including epithelioid sarcoma and other vascular neoplasms. As expected, a subset of epithelioid hemangiomas expresses FOSB, including angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Although occasional cases of nodular and proliferative fasciitis are positive for FOSB, distinction between these tumor types and pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is usually straightforward based on morphology and other immunophenotypic findings.</text>

<text>Association between Toll-like receptor and tumor necrosis factor immunological pathways in uterine cervical neoplasms.</text>
</passage>

<text>INTRODUCTION: The immune system plays a critical role in the defense against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and its persistence. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane receptors responsible for activation of the innate immune response, and an association between TLR expression and uterine cervical cancer has been shown. Tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) are among the main mediators of skin and mucosa in   ammation. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the association between TLR and TNF immune expression and cervical cancer and premalignant cervical lesions. METHODS: A total of 64 embedded tissues were obtained from gynecological procedures, including 35 specimens with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 10 specimens with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) as well as 19 normal cervical samples. The expression of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TNF-a and TNF-b was measured by immunohistochemistry and graded into low and high levels of expression. RESULTS: There was an association between the expression levels of TLR2 and those of TNF-a and TNF-b (p = 0.01 and p = 0.021, respectively) in the cervical cancer and CIN groups. TLR4 expression was associated with TNF-a and TNF-b expression (p = 0.016 and p = 0.025, respectively) in these 2 groups. By contrast, TLR3 was not statistically associated with TNF-a or TNF-b in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: There might be an association of the TLR2 and TLR4 pathways with the immunological response of TNF-a and TNF-b in cervical cancer. These markers are also expressed at higher levels in cervical cancer and premalignant lesions compared to normal controls.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: TRPM2, one member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) protein super-family, is a Ca(2+)-permeable channel that is activated by oxidative stress and confers susceptibility to cell death. In the human tongue specimens of carcinoma and the tongue carcinoma SCC cell lines, we observed the enhanced expression of TRPM2. By means of the whole-cell electrophysiological recording, the ADPR-induced currents mediated by TRPM2 were recorded in cultured SCC9 cells. Moreover, after H2O2 treatment for 24   hours, the apoptotic number of SCC9 cells was significantly increased. However, the selectively knocked-down TRPM2 with the small interfering RNA technique inhibited the survival and migration of the SCC9 cancer cells, which was independent of the p53-p21 pathway, since the expression of p21 was enhanced after TRPM2 knockdown. Furthermore, the sub-cellular localization of TRPM2 was remarkably different between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. A significant amount of the TRPM2 proteins were located in the nuclei in cancer cells. All these data suggest that TRPM2 is essential for the survival and migration of SCC cancer cells and may be a potential target for the selective treatment of tongue cancer.</text>

<offset>83</offset>
<text>AIM: To investigate early and remote results of surgery in patients with recurrent non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) after previous chemoradiotherapy alone. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective study included 14 NSCLC patients (10 men and 4 women, mean age 52.6 years) who were operated in thoracic department for the period June 2008 - December 2013. Histologically squamous cell carcinoma prevailed (64.3%). Prior to surgery stage IIB was diagnosed in 2 patients, IIIA in 11 and IIIB in 1 patient. The dose of radiotherapy ranged from 45 to 70 Gr (median 58Gr). The average number of chemotherapy cycles was 3.8 per patient. Pneumonectomy was performed in all patients except one who underwent left-sided lower lobectomy. In all cases bronchial stump was covered by vascularized muscle flap (intercostal, latissimus dorsi). Postoperative complications were classified by TMM system (Thoracic Morbidity and Mortality System). RESULTS: Postoperative complications were observed in 7 (50.0%) patients including level II in 2 cases, IIIA in 1 case, IVA in 3 patients and V (death) in 1 (7.1%) patient. Postoperative stages of lung cancer were IB in 2 cases, IIA in 1, IIB in 5, IIIA in 4 and IIIB in 2 patients. Overall 1, 2 and 3-year survival rate was 89.1%, 82.0% and 48.0% respectively (median 35.0 months). Recurrence-free survival was 84.2%, 72.0% and 24.8%, respectively (median 28.0 months). Overall and recurrence-free 5-year survival rate was 10.8%. CONCLUSION:   Salvage   surgery may be recommended as individual approach in patients with reccurent lung cancer after previous chemoradiotherapy.</text>

<text>Carnosine Inhibits the Proliferation of Human Cervical Gland Carcinoma Cells Through Inhibiting Both Mitochondrial Bioenergetics and Glycolysis Pathways and Retarding Cell Cycle Progression.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Carnosine has been demonstrated to play an antitumorigenic role in certain types of cancer. However, its underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, the roles of carnosine in cell proliferation and its underlying mechanism were investigated in the cultured human cervical gland carcinoma cells HeLa and cervical squamous carcinoma cells SiHa. The results showed that carnosine exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HeLa cells, whereas its inhibitory action on the proliferation of SiHa cells was much weaker. Carnosine decreased the ATP content through inhibiting both mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis pathways in cultured HeLa cells but not SiHa cells. Carnosine reduced the activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase in TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle and the activities of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I, II, III, and IV in HeLa cells but not SiHa cells. Carnosine also decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of ClpP, which plays a key role in maintaining the mitochondrial function in HeLa cells. In addition, carnosine induced G1 arrest by inhibiting the G1-S phase transition in both HeLa and SiHa cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that carnosine has a strong inhibitory action on the proliferation of human cervical gland carcinoma cells rather than cervical squamous carcinoma cells. Mitochondrial bioenergetics and glycolysis pathways and cell cycle may be involved in the carnosine action on the cell proliferation in cultured human cervical gland carcinoma cells HeLa.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to explore programmed cell death-ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification in stage IIIB/IV lung squamous cell carcinoma (SQC). Correlations between PD-L1 and FGFR1, and with clinicopathological characteristics, efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy, and prognosis were analyzed. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight consecutive stage III/IV SQC patients were enrolled in this study from 2009 to 2014. Seventy-eight patients received platinum-based chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess PD-L1 expression and fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied to detect FGFR1 amplification. RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was detected in 61.7% (79/128) of lung SQC patients. Smokers had significantly higher PD-L1 expression rates than non-smokers (66.1% vs. 44.0%, P    =   0.042, respectively). The objective response and disease control rates for platinum-based chemotherapy were not significantly different between PD-L1 negative and positive patients (43.3% vs. 36.2%, P    =   0.434; 80.0% vs. 78.7% P    =   0.840, respectively); however, overall survival in PD-L1-negative patients was significantly longer than in PD-L1-positive patients (41.5 vs. 19.3   months, P    =   0.001). Twenty-five percent (32/128) of patients displayed FGFR1 amplification, with a lower rate in stage III patients compared to stage IV (17.1% vs. 36.5%, P    =   0.013, respectively). There was no significant difference in FGFR1 amplification levels between overall response, disease control or overall survival rates. No correlation was observed between PD-L1 expression and FGFR1 amplification ( P    =   0.916). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression may function as a prognostic factor in Chinese stage III/IV SQC patients. FGFR1 amplification is more prevalent in late stage SQC patients but does not predict chemotherapy response. There is no apparent correlation between PD-L1 expression and FGFR1 amplification.</text>

<offset>114</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate outcomes for patients with pathological N3 (pN3) neck disease from human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and determine variables predictive of survival. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series with chart review. METHODS: This study was conducted between 1998 and 2013 and included patients with HPV-related OPSCC treated with surgery with or without adjuvant therapy and who had pN3 nodal disease. The primary outcome was disease-specific survival (DSS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), adverse events, and gastrostomy tube rates. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were included, of whom 36 (90%) underwent adjuvant therapy. Median follow-up was 39 months (range, 2-147 months). Mean age was 56 years, and 87% were male. Seventeen patients (44%) underwent selective neck dissection, whereas six (15%) underwent radical (n   =   2) or extended radical (n   =   4) neck dissection. Ninety-two percent had extracapsular extension. Five-year Kaplan-Meier estimated DSS, OS, and DFS were 89% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 79%-99%), 87% (95% CI: 75%-99%), and 84% (95% CI: 72%-96%), respectively. The disease recurrence rate was 10% (5% regional, 5% distant metastasis). Patients with less than 5 pathologically positive lymph nodes (P   =   .041) had improved DFS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HPV-related OPSCC and pN3 nodal disease treated with surgery and adjuvant therapy have very favorable long-term survival and regional control. Patients with five or more pathologically positive lymph nodes may be at higher risk for recurrence. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4. Laryngoscope, 2016.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute and late toxicity as well as local control (LC) in T1 glottic cancer (GC) patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) in clinical practice. The Tokai Study Group for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology started RT treatment with a dose of 2.25 Gy for T1 GC in 2011. Ten institutions combined data from 104 patients with T1 squamous cell carcinoma between 2011 and 2015. In total, 104 patients with T1 GC were irradiated with a standard radiation dose of 63 Gy in 28 fractions.The median follow-up duration was 18 (3.7-49.5) months. Acute grade 3 adverse events were observed in 7 patients, with 4 patients (5%) having dermatitis and 3 patients (4%) having mucositis. Late adverse events above grade 3 were not observed. Two patients developed local recurrence. The rates of acute adverse events in the present study were comparable to those in previous studies that have used 2 Gy fractions of RT.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Emerging evidence indicates that Retinoic acid receptor-b (RARb) is a tumor suppressor in many types of tumor. However, whether or not RARb is a risk factor and is correlated to clinicopathological characteristics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. In this report, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the effects of RARb hypermethylation on the incidence of NSCLC and clinicopathological characteristics in human NSCLC patients. Final valuation and analysis of 1780 cancer patients from 16 eligible studies was performed. RARb hypermethylation was found to be significantly higher in NSCLC than in normal lung tissue, the pooled OR from 7 studies including 646 NSCLC and 580 normal lung tissues, OR = 6.05, 95% CI = 3.56-10.25, p&lt;0.00001. RARb hypermethylation was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma (AC) compared to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), pooled OR is 0.68 (95% CI = 0.52-0.89, p = 0.005). RARb hypermethylation was also found to occur significantly higher in smoker (n = 232) than non-smoker (n = 213) (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.54-3.93, p = 0.0002). Our results indicate that RARb hypermethylation correlates well with an increased risk in NSCLC patients. RARb geneinactivation caused by RARb methylation contributes the NSCLC tumorigenesis and may serve as a potential risk factor, diagnostic marker and drug target of NSCLC.</text>

<text>The current role of in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy within the continuum of actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>151</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Clinical differentiation between actinic keratosis (AK), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ, and invasive SCC and its variants may be difficult. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a non-invasive technique for in vivo skin imaging. OBJECTIVES: To explicate the diagnostic and monitoring use of RCM within the spectrum of AK and SCC, and evaluate the accuracy of RCM for these diagnoses relative to histopathology. MATERIALS _ METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. The quality was assessed using the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. RESULTS: Twenty-five eligible studies were included. Different diagnostic RCM features have been described for AK, actinic cheilitis (AC), erythroplasia of Queyrat, Bowen disease, invasive SCC, and keratoacanthoma (KA). The overall range of sensitivity and specificity of RCM for the diagnosis of SCC, AK, SCC in situ, and KA was 79-100% and 78-100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The current literature describes the use of RCM for diagnosing AK, AC, erythroplasia of Queyrat, Bowen disease, invasive SCC, and KA, as well as for monitoring treatments of AK, with good accuracy. Unfortunately, studies with high methodological quality are lacking. Pre-treatment of hyperkeratotic lesions and uniform definitions of RCM features are required to simplify the differentiation between AKs, SCC in situ, and SCC and its variants in clinical practice.</text>

</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>126</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: To report initial results ofadose escalation trial of single-fraction carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for peripheralstage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April, 2003 and February, 2012, 218 patients were treated. The total dose was raised from 28to 50Gy RBE. The patients were 157 males and 61 females with a median age of 75 years. The tumors were 123 T1 and 95 T2. One hundred thirty-four of these patients (61.5%) were medically inoperable. By histological type, there were 146 adenocarcinomas, 68 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 large cell carcinomas and 1 mucoepidermoid carcinoma. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 57.8 months (range 1.6 - 160.7). Overall survival rate (OS) at 5 years was 49.4%. Local control rate (LC) was 72.7%. A statistically significant difference (p=0.0001,log-rank test) in LC was seen between patients receiving 36 Gy RBE or more and those receiving less than 36 Gy RBE. In 20 patients irradiated with 48-50Gy RBE, LC at 5 years was 95.0%, OS was 69.2%, and progression free survival (PFS) was 60.0% (median follow-up was 58.6 months). With dose escalation, LC tended to improve. As for adverse lung and skin reactions, there were no patients with grade 3 or higher, and grade 2 was less than 2%. Regarding chest wall pain, only one patient had grade 3 latetoxicity. CONCLUSION: We reported the outcome of a dose escalation study of single-fraction CIRT for stage I NSCLC, showing the feasibility of obtaining excellent results comparable to previous fractionated regimens.</text>

<text>Sensitivity of Cytology Specimens From Bronchial Aspirate or Washing During Bronchoscopy in the Diagnosis of Lung Malignancies: An Update.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>138</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Routine collection of cytology specimens from bronchial aspirate or washing is thought to increase the sensitivity of bronchoscopy for diagnosing malignant lung lesions. However, the added value of this practice has not been reappraised in a context of changing epidemiology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective monocenter study, all cytology specimens from bronchial aspirate or washing collected between May 2011 and December 2014 and the corresponding patients' files were reviewed. The final diagnosis of malignancy was based on all available pathologic information. RESULTS: Bronchoscopy was performed in 2750 patients, and bronchial cytology specimens were collected during 667 procedures, including 474 aspirate or washing cytology specimens collected during conventional (n  = 366) or ultrasound-guided (EBUS) (n  = 108) bronchoscopy in 455 patients with malignant lung lesion(s). The predominant histologic types were lung adenocarcinoma (43.9%) and squamous cell carcinoma (25.2%), and 271 tumors (59.6%) were endoscopically visible. At least 1 endoscopic sample (bronchial cytology and/or biopsies and/or endobronchial ultrasound-guided samples) was positive for malignancy during 329 (69.4%) of the 474 endoscopies, including 79 samples obtained in nonvisible lesions. Only 67 bronchial cytology specimens proved positive (sensitivity, 14.7%; 95% confidence interval, 11.8%-18.3%), and only 1 specimen (0.2%) produced a diagnosis not made by other samples during the same procedure. CONCLUSION: In contrast with older studies, the added value of collecting cytology specimens from bronchial aspirate or washing during bronchoscopy in this series proved negligible, reflecting mainly the increasing prevalence of adenocarcinomas. Abandoning this technique could be considered in centers with similar expertise and patient populations.</text>

<text>Influence of possible predictor variables on the outcome of primary oral squamous cell carcinoma: a retrospective study of 392 consecutive cases at a single centre.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>164</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: The successful treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) depends on the treatment strategy. The prognosis is most often linked to the stage at initial presentation, but the effect of patient-related parameters on overall survival remains uncertain. In this study, 392 consecutive cases of OSCC seen between 2007 and 2013 at a single centre were analyzed retrospectively. Overall survival was assessed and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify associations between possible tumour-specific and patient-related variables and survival. The 5-year overall survival rate of the 392 patients (T stage 1-4) was 62.5%. Univariate analysis showed that sex, age, T stage, N stage, Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, operating time &gt;400min, and length of in-patient stay &gt;15 days were significantly associated with overall survival (all P&lt;0.05). Tumour location, alcohol abuse, and smoking were found not to have a significant influence (all P&gt;0.05). Age, T, N, and M stages, UICC stage, residual tumour status, recurrence, ASA status, and operating time &gt;400min were found to have a significant influence on overall survival in the multivariate analysis (each P&lt;0.05). These findings confirm that postoperative survival does not depend only on tumour-related characteristics. ASA status needs to be considered in treatment planning, as it significantly predicts patient survival.</text>

<text>Identification of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 DNA integration and the ensuing patterns of methylation in HPV-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>171</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Recent studies showed that human papillomavirus (HPV) integration contributes to the genomic instability seen in HPV-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HPV-HNSCC). However, the epigenetic alterations induced after HPV integration remains unclear. To identify the molecular details of HPV16 DNA integration and the ensuing patterns of methylation in HNSCC, we performed next-generation sequencing using a target-enrichment method for the effective identification of HPV16 integration breakpoints as well as the characterization of genomic sequences adjacent to HPV16 integration breakpoints with three HPV16-related HNSCC cell lines. The DNA methylation levels of the integrated HPV16 genome and that of the adjacent human genome were also analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing. We found various integration loci, including novel integration sites. Integration loci were located predominantly in the intergenic region, with a significant enrichment of the microhomologous sequences between the human and HPV16 genomes at the integration breakpoints. Furthermore, various levels of methylation within both the human genome and the integrated HPV genome at the integration breakpoints in each integrant were observed. Allele-specific methylation analysis suggested that the HPV16 integrants remained hypomethylated when the flanking host genome was hypomethylated. After integration into highly methylated human genome regions, however, the HPV16 DNA became methylated. In conclusion, we found novel integration sites and methylation patterns in HPV-HNSCC using our unique method. These findings may provide insights into understanding of viral integration mechanism and virus-associated carcinogenesis of HPV-HNSCC.</text>

<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>73</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: A protective effect of female sex hormones has been suggested to explain the male predominance in esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma, but evidence is lacking. We aimed to test whether menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) decreases the risk of these tumors. For comparison, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was also assessed. This population-based matched cohort study included all women who had ever used systemic MHT in Sweden in 2005-2012. A comparison cohort of non-users of MHT was matched to the MHT-users regarding age, parity, thrombotic events, hysterectomy, diabetes, obesity, smoking-related diseases, and alcohol-related diseases. Individuals with any previous cancer were excluded. Data on MHT use, cancer, comorbidity, and mortality were collected from well-established Swedish nationwide registers. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Different MHT regimens and age groups were compared in sub-group analyses. We identified 290,186 ever-users and 870,165 non-users of MHT. Ever-users had decreased ORs of esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR=0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85, n=46), gastric adenocarcinoma (OR=0.61, 95% CI 0.50-0.74, n=123), and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OR=0.57, 95% CI 0.39-0.83, n=33). The ORs were decreased for both estrogen-only MHT and estrogen and progestin combined MHT, and in all age groups. The lowest OR was found for esophageal adenocarcinoma in MHT-users younger than 60 years (OR=0.20, 95% CI 0.06-0.65). Our study suggests that MHT-users are at a decreased risk of esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma, and also of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The mechanisms behind these associations remain to be elucidated. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</text>

<text>Predictive markers for delayed lymph node metastases and survival in early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>110</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify clinicopathological and immunohistochemical factors predicting delayed lymph node metastases and survival in early oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). METHODS: The study included 85 consecutive patients with clinically T1 to T2N0 OSCC who were primarily surgically treated between 2000 and 2004. RESULTS: There were 68 men and 17 women (median age, 61 years; range, 34-82 years). Of all the patients, 25 (29.4%) developed delayed lymph node metastases within 3 to 42 months after treatment of the primary tumor. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified poorly differentiated tumors, low laminin, and high fibronectin expression as prognosticators of delayed lymph node metastases. Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that moderately differentiated tumors and delayed lymph node metastases had predictive value regarding survival. CONCLUSION: Large prospective investigations with reproducibility and the clinical translatability of immunohistochemical methods are needed in order to provide new and effective therapeutic strategies in the future.    2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

<text>Importance: There is a significant need to find biomarkers of response to radiotherapy and cetuximab in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and biomarkers that predict altered immunity, thereby enabling personalized treatment. Objectives: To examine whether the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-variant, a germline mutation in a microRNA-binding site in KRAS, is a predictive biomarker of cetuximab response and altered immunity in the setting of radiotherapy and cisplatin treatment and to evaluate the interaction of the KRAS-variant with p16 status and blood-based transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1). Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 891 patients with advanced HNSCC from a phase 3 trial of cisplatin plus radiotherapy with or without cetuximab (NRG Oncology RTOG 0522) were included in this study, and 413 patients with available samples were genotyped for the KRAS-variant. Genomic DNA was tested for the KRAS-variant in a CLIA-certified laboratory. Correlation of the KRAS-variant, p16 positivity, outcome, and TGF-b1 levels was evaluated. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with the Cox proportional hazards model. Main Outcomes and Measures: The correlation of KRAS-variant status with cetuximab response and outcome, p16 status, and plasma TGF-b1 levels was tested. Results: Of 891 patients eligible for protocol analyses (786 male [88.2%], 105 [11.2%] female, 810 white [90.9%], 81 nonwhite [9.1%]), 413 had biological samples for KRAS-variant testing, and 376 had plasma samples for TGF-b1 measurement. Seventy patients (16.9%) had the KRAS-variant. Overall, for patients with the KRAS-variant, cetuximab improved both progression-free survival (PFS) for the first year (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.94; P   =   .04) and overall survival (OS) in years 1 to 2 (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.86; P   =   .03). There was a significant interaction of the KRAS-variant with p16 status for PFS in patients treated without cetuximab. The p16-positive patients with the KRAS-variant treated without cetuximab had worse PFS than patients without the KRAS-variant (HR, 2.59; 95% CI, 0.91-7.33; P   =   .07). There was a significant 3-way interaction among the KRAS-variant, p16 status, and treatment for OS (HR, for KRAS-variant, cetuximab and p16 positive, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.03-1.66; HR for KRAS-variant, cetuximab and p16 negative, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.48-4.26; HR for KRAS-variant, no cetuximab and p16 positive, 2.48; 95% CI, 0.64-9.65; and HR for KRAS-variant, no cetuximab and p16 negative, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.23-1.59; P   =   .02). Patients with the KRAS-variant had significantly elevated TGF-b1 plasma levels (median, 23 376.49 vs 18 476.52 pg/mL; P = .03) and worse treatment-related toxic effects. Conclusions and Relevance: Patients with the KRAS-variant with HNSCC significantly benefit from the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy and cisplatin, and there is a significant interaction between the KRAS-variant and p16 status. Elevated TGF-b1 levels in patients with the KRAS-variant suggests that cetuximab may help these patients by overcoming TGF-b1-induced suppression of antitumor immunity.

<text>Ocular Reconstruction Using Bone-Anchored Implants in Irradiated Facial Deformities After Tumor Extirpation.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>108</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of ocular malignancies can result in complex craniofacial defects that can be difficult to reconstruct with conventional reconstruction techniques. Craniofacial prosthesis supported by bone-anchored implants has evolved as a reliable alternative in such scenarios. METHODS: The authors describe a patient who underwent extensive facial resection secondary to squamous cell carcinoma resulting in significant facial deformities. A bone-anchored osseointegrated implant was used to perform facial reconstruction. RESULTS: The patient had successful reconstruction of her orbit with bone-anchored implant. However, her implant needed to be removed 10 months postoperatively secondary to infection. A second attempt at implant placement has been deferred due to osteonecrosis secondary to adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Bone-anchored implants can provide an elegant alternative in the reconstruction of complex facial defects and provide direct access to surveillance for possible tumor recurrence. However, these bone-supported prosthetics should be used with caution in patients undergoing irradiation.</text>

<text>Fucoidan reduced the invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells and modified their effects to macrophages.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>110</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Fucoidan is a complex of polysaccharides showing antitumor and immunomodulation properties. Our previous studies found its regulation to myeloid immune cells, including macrophages. Aberrant infiltration and functions of macrophages are commonly found in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we analyzed the effects of fucoidan on invasion of OSCC cells, and their regulation to macrophages, trying to evaluate its role as a potential therapy for OSCC. CAL27 and THP-1-derived macrophages were used as models for OSCC cells and tumor-infiltrated macrophages in the in vitro study, respectively. The effects of fucoidan on invasion of OSCC cells and their recruitment to macrophages were analyzed by transwell assay. KIF4A siRNA transfection was performed to investigate its role in fucoidan-modulated OSCC cells invasion. CCL3-neutralizing antibody was added into the conditioned medium of OSCC cells to evaluate its role in fucoidan-mediated macrophages recruitment and re-education. Fucoidan reduced the invasive potential of CAL27 cells with a decrease of MMP-2 and KIF4A transcription. KIF4A knockdown in CAL27 cells led to decreased invasion and MMP-2 expression. The conditioned medium of fucoidan-treated CAL27 cells promoted recruitment and inflammatory cytokines secretion on THP-1-derived macrophages. Further analysis found that fucoidan increased CCL3 production in CAL27 cells. Blocking CCL3 expression reversed the effects of fucoidan on macrophage recruitment and re-education. Our study found that fucoidan regulated the invasion of OSCC cells and also their recruiting and re-educating effects on macrophages, suggesting it could be a complementary approach in the treatment of OSCC.</text>

<text>A phase I study of tivantinib in combination with temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>102</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Background A wide variety of human cancers exhibit dysregulated c-Met activity that has implications in oncogenesis. Phosphorylation of c-Met results in activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Combined blockade of c-Met and mTOR pathways has shown efficacy in preclinical studies. Tivantinib is a c-Met inhibitor and temsirolimus is a selective mTOR inhibitor. We aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), adverse events (AEs), clinical activity and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of the combination. Methods This open-label phase I study used a 3  +  3 dose escalation design. Patients (pts) were treated with escalating doses of tivantinib (120-360  mg tablets orally twice daily) and temsirolimus (20  mg IV weekly) followed by dose expansion at the MTD. Separate cohorts were planned for extensive (normal) and poor tivantinib metabolizers based on CYP2C19 genotypes. Cycles were 28  days besides cycle 1 that was 35  days to allow for PK analysis. Results Twenty-nine pts. [median age 58 (range 28-77)] were enrolled (21 in dose escalation and 8 in dose expansion). All were extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers. The most common types of cancer were colorectal, ovarian and non-small cell lung. Sixteen out of 21 and 6 out of 8 pts. were evaluable for DLT evaluation per protocol in the dose escalation and dose expansion phases, respectively. Pts remained on study for a median of 71  days (range 18-296). The MTD and RP2D was tivantinib 240  mg twice daily and temsirolimus 20  mg weekly. DLTs included grade (gr) 4 neutropenia (2 pts.; 1 with gr 3 febrile neutropenia), gr 3 abdominal pain (1  pt) and gr 2 mucositis resulting in inadequate drug delivery. The most common treatment related AEs grade  &gt;=   2 included: anemia (gr 2 in 9 pts., gr 3 in 3 pts), fatigue (gr 2 in 10 pts), anorexia (gr 2 in 9 pts), hypoalbuminemia (gr 2 in 6 pts., gr 3 in 2 pts), hypophosphatemia (gr 2 in 2 pts., gr 3 in 5 pts) and nausea (gr 2 in 6 pts., gr 3 in 1  pt). One pt. with ovarian cancer had a confirmed partial response and remained on study for 10  months, a second patient with ovarian cancer had stable disease and remained on study for 6  months and a third pt. with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue had stable disease and remained on study for 7  months. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there is no interaction in the plasma concentrations between tivantinib and temsirolimus. Conclusions The combination of tivantinib with temsirolimus appears to be well tolerated with evidence of clinical activity.</text>

<text>Nodal parameters of FDG PET/CT performed during radiotherapy for locally advanced mucosal primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma can predict treatment outcomes: SUVmean and response rate are useful imaging biomarkers.</text>
</passage>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>224</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic utility of nodal metabolic parameters derived from FDG PET/CT performed before radiotherapy (prePET) and during the third week of radiotherapy (iPET) in patients with mucosal primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (MPHNSCC). METHODS: This analysis included 75 patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced node-positive MPHNSCC treated with radical radiotherapy and concurrent systemic therapy who underwent prePET and iPET: N1 11 patients, N2a 38, N2b 12, N2c 9, N3 5. The median follow-up was 28  months (9  -  70  months). The maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and total lesional glycolysis (TLG) of the index lymph node (node with the highest TLG) and the combined total lymph nodes, and their percentage reductions on iPET were determined, and the results were correlated with 3-year Kaplan-Meier locoregional, regional and distant metastatic failure-free survival (FFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Optimal cut-off values were derived from receiver operating characteristic curves. Cox regression univariate and multivariate analyses with clinical covariates were performed. RESULTS: Based on assessment of residual nodal metabolic burden during treatment, the iPET index node SUVmean (optimal cut-off value 2.95 g/ml) and the total node SUVmean (optimal cut-off value 3.25) were the best independent predictors of outcome in the multivariate analysis: index node SUVmean for DFS and OS p   =   0.033 and 0.003, respectively, and the total node SUVmean for locoregional FFS, DFS and OS p   =   0.028, 0.025 and 0.014, respectively. Based on the assessment of response rates during treatment, a reduction of more than 50  % in the total node TLG was the best biomarker for locoregional and regional FFS, DFS and OS in the multivariate analysis (p   =   0.001, 0.016, 0.001 and 0.004, respectively), and reduction in the total node MTV for locoregional FFS, DFS and OS (p   =   0.026, 0.003 and 0.014, respectively). There were no significant correlations between oncological outcomes and prePET nodal parameters. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the index node and total node SUVmean on iPET and a reduction of more than 50  % in MTV and TLG are useful imaging biomarkers, and can potentially identify those patients with MPHNSCC who have a high risk of locoregional metastatic failure and death.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The overexpression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been observed in many cancers and inhibition of specific HDAC has emerged as a new target for cancer therapy. The present study examined the expression of HDAC8 and the inhibitory effect of HDAC8 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The expression of HDAC8 was measured in human OSCC tissues and OSCC cell lines using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. HDAC8 was knocked down in OSCC cells by transfection with HDAC8 siRNAs and cell proliferation was quantified. Apoptosis and autophagy were measured using flow cytometry and immunoblotting. HDAC8 were overexpressed in OSCC tissues and OSCC cells, mainly localized in the cytoplasm. HDAC8 siRNAs effectively reduced the level of HDAC8 expression and HDAC8 silencing significantly inhibited the proliferation of OSCC cells. HDAC8 knockdown induced apoptotic cell death through caspases activation and pro-survival autophagy in OSCC cells. Combination with HDAC silencing and autophagy inhibition enhanced cell death by increasing apoptosis in OSCC cells. This study suggests that inhibition of HDAC8 might become a novel therapeutic strategy for OSCC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The objective of this study was to investigate the role of ErbB3-binding protein 1 (Ebp1) in the growth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells and the underlying mechanism. Eca109 and KYSE150 cells were transfected with lentiviral vector carrying Ebp1 gene. The mRNA levels of Ebp1 in esophageal cancer tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues were examined by real-time PCR. The growth and viability of esophageal carcinoma cells were assessed using MTT and crystal violet assays, respectively. Clone-forming abilities of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells were analyzed by soft agar assay. Apoptotic rates of esophageal carcinoma cells were detected by flow cytometry, and expression levels of the proteins involved in apoptosis were assessed by Western blot. Tumorigenicity of Eca109 cells were detected by nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment. The results indicated that the mRNA levels of Ebp1 in esophageal cancer tissues was down-regulated compared with paired adjacent normal tissues. The growth and viability of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells were all suppressed by Ebp1 overexpression. Besides, Ebp1 overexpression induced apoptosis, increased Rb and P53 expressions, and decreased CyclinD1 expression in Eca109 and KYSE150 cells. In addition, Ebp1 overexpression inhibited the tumorigenesis of Eca109 cells in vivo. These results suggest that Ebp1 may suppress the growth of esophageal carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis.</text>

<text>FNA biopsy of secondary nonlymphomatous malignancies in salivary glands: A multi-institutional study of 184 cases.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>114</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Secondary malignancies of salivary glands (SMSGs) are among the most common malignant neoplasms to involve the salivary glands. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of SMSG can present diagnostic challenges. The current report presents the largest such FNAB series to date. METHODS: A search of the pathology database from 6 academic institutions identified 184 FNAB cases of nonlymphomatous SMSG. RESULTS: Of the 184 cases, 171 were of the parotid glands, and 13 were of the submandibular glands; 130 patients were men, and 54 were women, and the mean patient age at diagnosis was 68 years. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from all sites (n   =   87) and melanoma (n   =   67) constituted the majority of SMSGs. Less frequent SMSGs were comprised of metastatic carcinomas from distant organs (n   =   16), including sites in the breast, lung, kidney, thyroid, pancreatobiliary, prostate, and bladder. Other uncommon SMSGs, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (n   =   3), sarcoma (n   =   4), other metastatic skin-derived carcinomas (n   =   6), and metastatic chordoma (n   =   1), also were observed. Ancillary tests were performed on 37 FNAB specimens (20.1%) to aid the evaluation. One hundred forty-seven specimens (79.9%) had a definitive diagnosis with accurate tumor subtyping, 21 (11.4%) had a definitive malignant diagnosis but without specifying subtype, 9 (4.9%) had an indeterminate diagnosis, and 7 (3.8%) had a false-negative diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: SMSGs originate predominately from the head and neck and are more common in older men. Overall, the FNAB diagnosis of SMSG is accurate, but diagnostic challenges can be encountered, especially in SCC types of SMSG. Ancillary studies are needed for the definitive diagnosis of challenging cases. Cancer Cytopathol 2016.    2016 American Cancer Society.</text>

<text>MicroRNA  -375 inhibits oral squamous cell carcinoma cell migration and invasion by targeting platelet  -derived growth factor  -A.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>131</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: MicroRNA  -375 (miR  -375) serves an important role in cancer development and growth. However, little is known about the role of miR  -375 in the regulation of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) metastasis and invasion. The present study measured the expression levels of miR  -375 in Tca8113, UM2, UM1 and CAL  -27 cell lines, using reverse transcription  -quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that miR  -375 expression levels were significantly reduced in UM1 and CAL  -27 (highly metastatic) compared with Tca8113 and UM2 (less aggressive) OSCC cell lines. Furthermore, it was revealed that overexpression of miR  -375 suppressed the migration and invasion of UM1 cells. Based on a luciferase reporter assay, platelet  -derived growth factor  -A (PDGF  -A) was identified as a direct target gene of miR  -375. Additionally, overexpression of PDGF  -A significantly reversed the effect of miR  -375 on cell migration and invasion in UM1 cells. These data demonstrated that miR  -375 suppressed OSCC cell migration and invasion by targeting PDGF  -A, which may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of OSCC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: C14orf166, a 28  kD protein regulating RNA transcription and translation, may serve a critical role in oncogenesis. The aim of the current study was to explore the association between C14orf166 expression and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to draw attention to the association between C14orf166 and the initiation, progression and prognosis of ESCC. C14orf166 expression in ESCC and paired normal tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining, western blotting and reverse transcription  -quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the association between C14orf166 expression and clinicopathological characters of ESCC was analyzed. Survival analysis was used to assess the prognostic significance of C14orf166 and it was observed that C14orf166 expression was higher in the ESCC tissues when compared with adjacent non  -cancerous tissues at protein (P&lt;0.001) and mRNA levels (P&lt;0.001). There was a significant difference in T stage, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in patients categorized according to different C14orf166 expression levels. The overexpression of C14orf166 was associated with a shorter overall survival and disease  -free survival, and multivariate analysis indicated that C14orf166 was an independent prognostic indicator. The present study indicates that the expression of C14orf166 is elevated in ESCC, and is potentially a valuable prognostic predictor for ESCC.</text>

<text>Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index Predicts Prognosis of Patients with Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Propensity Score-matched Analysis.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>143</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, was recently investigated as a prognostic marker in several tumors. However, SII has not been reported in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We evaluated the prognostic value of the SII in 916 patients with ESCC who underwent radical surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were calculated by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to compare the discrimination ability for OS. PSM (propensity score matching) was carried out to imbalance the baseline characteristics. Our results showed that SII, PLR, NLR and MLR were all associated with OS in ESCC patients in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. However, only SII was an independent risk factor for OS (HR   =   1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.53, P   =   0.042) among these systemic inflammation scores. The AUC for SII was bigger than PLR, NLR and MLR. In the PSM analysis, SII still remained an independent predictor for OS (HR   =   1.30, CI 1.05-1.60, P   =   0.018). SII is a novel, simple and inexpensive prognostic predictor for patients with ESCC undergoing radical esophagectomy. The prognostic value of SII is superior to PLR, NLR and MLR.</text>

<text>Towards Tyrosine Metabolism in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>66</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) is a common malignant tumor in China, which causes about 200,000 deaths each year. Sensitive biomarkers are helpful to diagnosis of the disease in early stage. METHOD: To identify biomarkers of ESCC and elucidate underlying mechanism of the disease, a targeted metabolomics strategy based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been implemented to explore tyrosine metabolism from 40 ESCC patients and 27 healthy controls. RESULTS: Four metabolites, i.e. phenylalanine, 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were identified as diagnostic biomarkers for ESCC patients. Based on these biomarkers, a prediction model was constructed for ESCC diagnosis. The analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve confirmed its effectiveness of the model. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that tyrosine metabolism is disturbed in ESCC patients and the metabolites involved in tyrosine pathway can be used as diagnostic biomarkers of the disease. Findings of this study can help investigate pathogenesis of ESCC and facilitate understanding mechanism of the disease.</text>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>95</offset>
<text>AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate, compare, and correlate the types of collagen fibers seen in different grades of oral cancer. METHODS: Thirty cases of histologically-diagnosed, well-, moderately-, and poorly-differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were retrieved from the archives of the Institute. Collagen was evaluated using picrosirius red stain and immunohistochemical analysis of the antibody to type III collagen. A correlation between these findings and the grade of OSCC was evaluated. RESULTS: Collagen fibers showed a change in birefringence ranging from reddish-orange to greenish-yellow in well- to poorly-differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma. The findings were statistically significant for polarizing colors observed in grades of OSCC (P&lt;.001). Immunohistochemical staining intensity of type III collagen changed from weak to strong as grade increased for OSCC, and was also statistically significant (P&lt;.001). CONCLUSION: In the present study, tumor progression reflected a change in collagen present, from type I to type III. Determination of the type of collagen in different grades of OSCC can facilitate therapeutic targeting of molecules responsible for invasion and progression of oral cancer.</text>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>141</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of cancer cachexia and its prognostic impact in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: The prevalence of cancer cachexia was analyzed according to the follow-up periods during the first year after curative initial treatment. Recurrences, noncancer health events (NCHEs), and cause-specific survival outcomes were also analyzed according to the incidence of cancer cachexia during follow-up. RESULTS: Cancer cachexia was identified in 22 (6.1%), 148 (41%), 66 (18.4%), and 65 (18.7%) of 361 enrolled patients at pretreatment, immediately after treatment, 6-months after treatment, and 12-months after treatment, respectively. Sustained or newly developed cachexia at 6 and 12 months showed a significant association with recurrence and NCHE occurrence (p   &lt;   .05). In cause-specific survival analysis, patients with cachexia had a higher probability of cancer-specific death, noncancerous death, and overall death (p   &lt;   .05). CONCLUSION: Cachexia prevalence at 6 and 12 months after treatment for HNSCC indicates a higher chance of recurrence, NCHE, and death.    2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2016.</text>

<text>Topical oral cavity chemoprophylaxis using isotretinoin rinse: A 15-year experience.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>84</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the utility of isotretinoin oral rinses as a method of chemoprevention for recurrent oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), carcinoma in situ, and dysplasia. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: One hundred forty-three patients were initially enrolled in the study; however, 18 were excluded due to inability to tolerate therapy. The included patients were classified into four groups. Group 1 included patients with multiple early stage oral cavity lesions following initial resection. Group 2 included patients with SCC in situ after excision. Group 3 included patients with multifocal dysplasia following initial CO2 laser ablation. Group 4 included patients with a history of treated oral cavity SCC with new leukoplakia lesions proven to be dysplastic. Fifty-three patients in the control group did not use post-treatment isotretinoin rinses due to various reasons, whereas 72 patients completed therapy. Minimum use of isotretinoin rinses was 12 months, and minimum follow-up was 24 months. During the follow-up period, all recurrences of carcinoma, in situ disease, and dysplasia were noted and compared with a Fisher test of fit. A Bonferroni correction was applied to increase accuracy and strength of comparison. RESULTS: Using a Bonferroni correction, the significance threshold was 0.0125. By that cutoff, isotretinoin rinses were found to be associated with lower recurrence in groups 1 and 3 (P   =   .00014, P   =   .00002, respectively) but not in groups 2 and 4 (P   =   .4, P   =   .3846, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Oral isotretinoin as chemoprophylaxis for patients treated for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, in situ disease, or dysplasia may be beneficial in decreasing recurrence rate.

<text>UNASSIGNED: Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint molecule-specific monoclonal antibody have obtained encouraging results from preclinical studies and clinical trials, which promoted us to explore whether this kind of immunotherapy could be applicable to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) is an immune checkpoint control protein that negatively regulates T cells and immune response. Here, using the human tissue samples, we report these findings that LAG-3 is overexpressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs; p &lt; 0.001) and its overexpression correlates with the high pathological grades, lager tumor size and positive lymph node status in human primary HNSCC. Survival analysis identifies LAG-3 as a prognostic factor independent of tumor size and pathological grades for primary HNSCC patients with negative lymph node status (p = 0.014). Study in immunocompetent genetically defined HNSCC mouse model reports that LAG-3 is upregulated on CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells and CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs). In vivo study, administration of LAG-3-specific antibody retards tumor growth in a way associated with enhanced systemic antitumor response by potentiating the antitumor response of CD8(+) T cells and decreasing the population of immunosuppressive cells. Taken together, our results offer a preclinical proof supporting the immunomodulatory effects of LAG-3 and suggest a potential therapeutic target of immunotherapy for HNSCC.</text>

<text>Characterization of nivolumab-associated skin reactions in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>111</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have led to considerable therapy improvement in cancer patients. Autoimmune side effects including skin reactions are frequently observed. In melanoma, those include rash and vitiligo and were shown to be associated with a prolonged overall survival. Little is known about skin reactions in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients during immunotherapy. Here, we retrospectively investigated immune-related adverse skin reactions (irAEs) in 40 patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. 7 out of 40 patients (17%) developed an irAEs. Skin irAEs correlated with tumor responses in 5 of 12 responders (42%) as compared to 2 of 27 non-responders (7%). Histologically, scaly plaques showed dermatitis consisting mainly of lymphocytes. We observed a positive correlation between skin irAEs and tumor responses in patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab. Patterns of lymphocytic skin infiltration differed depending on the histological tumor subtype (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma NSCLC).</text>

<text>Circulating Cell-Free DNA Levels Could Predict Oncological Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Esophagectomy for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>144</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a potential biomarker for cancer progression but its role is unclear in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) after esophagectomy. We investigated relationships between plasma cfDNA levels and clinicopathological parameters in ESCC patients. Eighty-one ESCC patients who received esophagectomy were enrolled. Plasma samples from these patients and 95 normal controls were collected. DNA copy numbers were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Subjects were divided into two groups by cfDNA level. Clinicopathological data were collected retrospectively and relationships between cfDNA levels and clinical parameters were evaluated. The cfDNA level in normal controls ranged from 0-4157 copies/mL. The cfDNA level of 96.3% ESCC patients was higher than the cutoff value (2447.26 copies/mL) with a specificity of 94.1%. The mean cfDNA concentration was 5918 copies/mL in lower and 53,311 copies/mL in higher cfDNA groups. No correlations were found between clinicopathological factors and cfDNA levels except for lymphovascular invasion. Higher cfDNA levels were associated with tumor relapse (p = 0.018). Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 34.7% and 33.8%, respectively. Patients with higher cfDNA levels had poorer DFS (p = 0.013). Patients with higher cfDNA levels had poorer OS, but not significantly (p = 0.164). Circulating cfDNA could be a biomarker for tumor relapse of ESCC with high sensitivity and specificity. Higher cfDNA levels were associated with tumor relapse and shorter DFS after esophagectomy in ESCC patients.</text>

<text>S4S8-RPA phosphorylation as an indicator of cancer progression in oral squamous cell carcinomas.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>96</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral cancers are easily accessible compared to many other cancers. Nevertheless, oral cancer is often diagnosed late, resulting in a poor prognosis. Most oral cancers are squamous cell carcinomas that predominantly develop from cell hyperplasias and dysplasias. DNA damage is induced in these tissues directly or indirectly in response to oncogene-induced deregulation of cellular proliferation. Consequently, a DNA Damage response (DDR) and a cell cycle checkpoint is activated. As dysplasia transitions to cancer, proteins involved in DNA damage and checkpoint signaling are mutated or silenced decreasing cell death while increasing genomic instability and allowing continued tumor progression. Hyperphosphorylation of Replication Protein A (RPA), including phosphorylation of Ser4 and Ser8 of RPA2, is a well-known indicator of DNA damage and checkpoint activation. In this study, we utilize S4S8-RPA phosphorylation as a marker for cancer development and progression in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). S4S8-RPA phosphorylation was observed to be low in normal cells, high in dysplasias, moderate in early grade tumors, and low in late stage tumors, essentially supporting the model of the DDR as an early barrier to tumorigenesis in certain types of cancers. In contrast, overall RPA expression was not correlative to DDR activation or tumor progression. Utilizing S4S8-RPA phosphorylation to indicate competent DDR activation in the future may have clinical significance in OSCC treatment decisions, by predicting the susceptibility of cancer cells to first-line platinum-based therapies for locally advanced, metastatic and recurrent OSCC.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of mir-106b in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissue and analyze its correlation with the clinicopathologic features of ESCC. METHODS: A total of 200 fresh surgical specimens of ESCC and adjacent tissues collected between 2001 and 2007 were examined for expressions of mir-106b using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Northern blot analysis for mir-106b was performed in 4 pairs of samples to confirm the RT-PCR results. The relationship between mir-106b expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Mir-106b was expressed at significantly higher levels in ESCC tissues than in the paired adjacent tissues. Overexpression of mir-106b was associated with lymph node metastasis, stage of TNM classification and smoking (P&lt;0.05). The survival rate of patients with low mir-106b expression was higher than that of patients with high mir-106b expression (60 vs 37 months, P=0.024). Cox regression analysis indicated that the expression of mir-106b, lymph node metastasis and smoking were independent prognostic factors for ESCC (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Mir-106b is overexpressed in ESCC tumors, and its overexpression is strongly associated with lymph node metastasis and a poor prognosis. Mir-106b expression is an independent prognostic factor for ESCC and can serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of ESCC.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interaction of polymorphisms of PPAR-y2 gene -C34G and NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox gene -C242T with helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) . METHODS: A total of 200 cases of LSCC of Broder grade I, 200 of Broder grade II and of grade III were enrolled in this study with 200 healthy individuals as the control group. The genetic polymorphisms of PPAR-y2 gene -C34G and NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox gene -C242T were analyzed using PCR-RFLP in peripheral blood leukocytes. (14)C-urea breath test ((14)C-UBT) was used to test (14)C disntegration per minute (DPM) for evaluating the infection status of H. pylori. An unconditional logistic regression model was used to analyze the interaction of nucleotide polymorphisms and H. pylori infection. RESULTS: The risk of ESCC significantly increased in subjects with -C34G (CG), -C34G(GG), -C242T (CT), and -C242T (TT) genotypes. Combined analysis of the polymorphisms showed that the subjects carrying -C34G (GG)/ -C242T (TT) had a high risk of ESCC, and a positive interaction was found between -C34G (GG) and -C242T (TT) in increasing the risk of ESCC. Positive interactions in the pathogenesis of ESCC were also found between -C34G (CG) and -C242T (TT), between -C34G (CG) and -C242T (CT), and between -C34G (GG) and -C242T (CT) (y&gt;1). The risk of ESCC significantly increased in subjects with H. pylori infection, which showed positive interactions with -C34G (CG), -C34G (GG), -C242T (CT) and -C242T (TT) in increasing the risk of ESCC (y&gt;1). CONCLUSION: Individuals carrying -C34G(CG), -C34G(GG), -C242T (CT) and -C242T (TT) genotypes have a high risk of developing ESCC, and these genotypes interact with H. pylori infection in the pathogenesis of LSCC, suggesting the importance of eradicating H. pylori for prevention of ESCC.</text>

<offset>174</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Objective: To investigate the survival, recurrence patterns and risk factors in patients with stage    A-N2 NSCLC treated with curative surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy and to explore the significance of postoperative radiation therapy. Methods: The clinical data of 290 patients with pathologically diagnosed stage    A-N2 NSCLC after curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy from January 2010 to December 2014 at our department were retrospectively analyzed. The survival and recurrence patterns were observed, and the factors affecting locoregional recurrence were analyzed. Results: The median survival time was 31.5 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year survival rates were 88.3%, 46.0% and 33.2%, respectively. The median locoregional control time was 38.5 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year locoregional control rates were 78.6%, 55.2% and 41.0%, respectively. The median distant metastasis-free survival was 26.8 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rates were 76.4%, 45.5% and 39.5%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 19.1 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 64.1%, 32.5% and 23.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that clinical N status, histological type, pathological T stage, operation mode, the number of positive N2 lymph nodes and the number of positive N2 lymph node stations had a significant influence on overall survival; clinical N status, histological type, the number of positive N2 lymph nodes and the number of positive N2 lymph node stations had a significant influence on locoregional control. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the number of N2 positive lymph nodes (P= 0.017) was an independent factor for overall survival of stage    A-N2 patients; the number of N2 positive lymph nodes (P=0.009) and histological type (P=0.005) were independent factors for locoregional recurrence. For left-sided lung cancer, the lymph node station failure sites were mostly in 2R, 4R, 5, 6 and 7, and the contralateral mediastinum was frequently involved. For right-sided lung cancer, the lymph node station failure sites were mostly in 2R, 4R, 7, 10R and surgical stump. Conclusions: Clinical N2, squamous cell carcinoma, positive N2 nodes of more than 3 and multiple positive N2 stations are poor prognostic factors for locoregional recurrence. Locoregional recurrence of left lung cancer frequently involves the contralateral mediastinum, while that of the right lung cancer usually locates in the ipsilateral mediastinum.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Objective: To explore the effects of both folic acid, p16 protein expression and their interaction on progression of cervical cancerization. Methods: Participants were pathologically diagnosed new cases, including 80 women with normal cervical (NC), 55 patients with low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN   ), 55 patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN   /   ) and 64 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Serum folate levels were detected by microbiological assay method while p16 protein expression levels were measured by Western-blot. In vitro, cervical cancer cell lines C33A (HPV negative) and Caski (HPV16 positive) were treated with different concentrations of folate. Proliferation and apoptosis of cells and the levels of p16 protein expression were measured in groups with different folic acid concentrations. Results: Results showed that the levels of serum folate were (5.96  3.93) ng/ml, (5.08  3.43) ng/ml, (3.92  2.59) ng/ml and (3.18  2.71) ng/ml, and the levels of p16 protein were 0.80  0.32, 1.33  0.52, 1.91  0.77, and 2.09  0.72 in the group of NC, CIN   , CIN   /    and SCC, respectively. However, the levels of serum folate decreased (trend   (2)=32.71, P&lt;0.001) and p16 protein expression increased (trend   (2)=56.06, P&lt;0.001) gradually along with the severity of cervix lesions. An additive interaction was seen between serum folate deficiency and high expression of p16 protein in the CIN   , CIN   /    and SCC group. Results in vitro showed that, with the increase of folate concentration, the inhibition rate of cell proliferation (C33A: r=0.928, P=0.003; Caski: r=0.962, P=0.001) and the rate on cell apoptosis (C33A: r=0.984, P&lt;0.001; Caski: r=0.986, P&lt;0.001) all increased but the levels of p16 protein expression (C33A: r=-0.817, P=0.025; Caski: r=-0.871, P=0.011) reduced. The proliferation inhibition rate (C33A: r=-0.935, P=0.002; Caski: r=-0.963, P=0.001) and apoptosis rate of cells (C33A: r=-0.844, P=0.017; Caski: r=-0.898, P=0.006) were negatively correlated with the levels of p16 protein expression. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that both serum folate deficiency and high expression of p16 protein could increase the risk of cervical cancer and cervix precancerous lesion, and there was an additive interaction between them. Our findings suggested that folic acid supplementation could reverse the abnormal expression of p16 protein, and effectively promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in cervical carcinoma cells.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: BCCIP was originally identified as a BRCA2 interacting protein in humans and Ustilago maydis. It had low expression in some human cancer tissues. However, recent research indicated that many caretaker genes are also necessary for cell viability and their expression could contribute to tumor progression. AIM: To characterize whether BCCIP is a caretaker gene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to measure the expression of BCCIP b. In vitro studies were used to verify the effects of BCCIP b in Eca109 cells. RESULTS: Expression of BCCIP b was notably higher in tumor tissues of ESCC and Eca 109 cells. Meanwhile, the immunohistochemistry stain revealed that BCCIP b was positively correlated with clinical pathologic variables such as tumor size and tumor grade, as well as Ki-67, and prompted poor prognosis. In vitro studies such as starvation and refeeding assay along with BCCIP b-shRNA transfection assay demonstrated that BCCIP b expression promoted proliferation of ESCC cells. In addition, BCCIP b downregulation by silencing RNA significantly decreased the rate of colony formation, alleviated cellular apoptosis and increased the chemosensitivity of cisplatin. CONCLUSIONS: This research first put forward that BCCIP b is an oncogene in human ESCC and contributes to the poor outcome of the deadly disease.</text>

<text>Fibular flap for mandible reconstruction in osteoradionecrosis of the jaw: selection criteria of fibula flap.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>109</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Osteoradionecrosis is the most dreadful complication after head and neck irradiation. Orocutaneous fistula makes patients difficult to eat food. Fibular free flap is the choice of the flap for mandibular reconstruction. Osteocutaneous flap can reconstruct both hard and soft tissues simultaneously. This study was to investigate the success rate and results of the free fibular flap for osteoradionecrosis of the mandible and which side of the flap should be harvested for better reconstruction. METHODS: A total of eight consecutive patients who underwent fibula reconstruction due to jaw necrosis from March 2008 to December 2015 were included in this study. Patients were classified according to stages, primary sites, radiation dose, survival, and quality of life. RESULTS: Five male and three female patients underwent operation. The mean age of the patients was 60.1  years old. Two male patients died of recurred disease of oral squamous cell carcinoma. The mean dose of radiation was 70.5  Gy. All fibular free flaps were survived. Five patients could eat normal diet after operation; however, three patients could eat only soft diet due to loss of teeth. Five patients reported no change of speech after operation, two reported worse speech ability, and one patient reported improved speech after operation. The ipsilateral side of the fibular flap was used when intraoral soft tissue defect with proximal side of the vascular pedicle is required. The contralateral side of the fibular flap was used when extraoral skin defect with proximal side of the vascular pedicle is required. CONCLUSIONS: Osteonecrosis of the jaw is hard to treat because of poor healing process and lack of vascularity. Free fibular flap is the choice of the surgery for jaw bone reconstruction and soft tissue fistula repair. The design and selection of the right or left fibular is dependent on the available vascular pedicle and soft tissue defect sites.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Lung tumors are extremely rare in the pediatric population, comprising only 0.2% of all malignancies in children. Among them, mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is even rarer with a reported frequency of 0.1% to 0.2%. MEC is defined by the World Health Organization as a tumor characterized by a combination of mucus-secreting, squamous, and intermediate cell types. We describe the case of a 4-year-old girl who presented with a history of intermittent fever and nonproductive cough of 1-month duration after foreign body aspiration. The chest X-ray showed complete collapse of the left lung. After removal of the foreign body, the lung expanded well after. However, the control chest X-ray done after 5 days showed again complete collapse of the left lung. The biopsy specimen taken during bronchoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of low-grade MEC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the presence of MAML2 rearrangement. Complete surgical resection with preservation of lung parenchyma was performed. No adjuvant therapy was needed. Repeat bronchoscopy was performed 2 months after surgery and showed no recurrence of the tumor. In conclusion, a remote chest X-ray after removal of a foreign body is necessary to avoid missing a rare serious underlying disease such as MEC. According to the size and the location of the tumor, complete surgical removal is sufficient without additional treatment in case of low-grade tumor. The presence of MAML2 rearrangement confers a favorable outcome and may have long-term implications for the clinical management.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Background: Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in tumor cells in promoter regions is a critical event in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) tumorigenesis and can be a potential diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC patients. The present study systemically and quantitatively reviewed the diagnostic ability of CDH13 methylation in NSCLC as well as in its subsets. Eligible studies were identified through searching PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Embase. The pooled odds of CDH13 promoter methylation in lung cancer tissues versus normal controls were calculated by meta-analysis method. Simultaneously, four independent DNA methylation datasets of NSCLC from TCGA and GEO database were downloaded and analyzed to validate the results from meta-analysis. Results: Thirteen studies, including 1850 samples were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio of CDH13 promoter methylation in cancer tissues was 7.41 (95% CI: 5.34 to 10.29, P &lt; 0.00001) compared with that in controls under fixed-effect model. In validation stage, 126 paired samples from TCGA were analyzed and 5 out of the 6 CpG sites in the CpG island of CDH13 were significantly hypermethylated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues but none of the 6 CpG sites was hypermethylated in squamous cell carcinoma tissues. Concordantly, the results from other three datasets, which were subsequently obtained from GEO database consisting of 568 tumors and 256 normal tissues, also consisted with those from TCGA dataset. Conclusion: The pooled data showed that the methylation status of the CDH13 promoter is strongly associated with lung adenocarcinoma. The CDH13 methylation status could be a promising diagnostic biomarker for diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma.</text>

<text>Alteration status and prognostic value of MET in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>

<offset>87</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: The MET pathway plays a key role in various cancers, and its inhibition represents a potential treatment target. However, appropriate biomarkers are needed to facilitate the selection of patients who would benefit from MET inhibiting therapy. We herein conducted a robust confirmatory evaluation of the MET copy number alteration status and prognostic significance of c-Met expression in a large series of patients (n = 396) who underwent standard surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Surgically resected HNSCC samples were subjected to immunohistochemical and H-score analysis of c-Met expression and silver in situ hybridization analysis of MET amplification and copy number gains. c-Met expression varied, with mean and median H-scores (scale: 0-300 scale) of 61.2 and 60.0, respectively. The lowest and highest expression levels were observed in SCC of the larynx and oral cavity, respectively. MET copy number gains were observed in 16.9% of cases (67/339) and were associated with c-Met protein expression. High c-Met expression, determined according to MET gain status, was associated with an inferior overall survival rate, especially among completely resected cases. In conclusion, our robust analysis revealed that c-Met expression in HNSCCs varied according to anatomical site, correlated with MET copy number gains, and was associated with poor prognosis. This c-Met expression analysis method, which is based on the MET gain status, appears to appropriately predict high-risk HNSCC patients in the context of anti-MET therapeutic decisions.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: TUSC3 was recently identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene in a variety of human malignancies. However, no data are currently available regarding the expressions of TUSC3 in esophageal cancer (ESCC).The purposes of this study was to investigated the expressions of TUSC3 in ESCC tissues and assess the relationship between TUSC3 levels and clinico-pathological characteristics of ESCC patients. TUSC3 protein expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarray slides in esophageal cancer, which included 95 esophageal squamous carcinoma specimens (ESCC), and 75 normal esophageal mucosa (NEM). We found that TUSC3 in ESCC was significant lower than that in NEM (P=0.000). According to multi-clinical classifications, TUSC3 level varied significantly with TNM stage, T stage, and N stage (p&lt;0.001, p=0.0368, p&lt;0.0001, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that gender, TNM stage, T stage, N stage, TUSC3 expression were prognostic factors for survival. Multivariate analysis showed that in our study, only TUSC3 expression was independent prognostic factors for ESCC. Our results indicated for the first time, a combined analysis of TUSC3 expressions as well as the clinical variables will help predict the prognosis of ESCC patients. Further large-sample validation and functional analysis should be performed to evaluate its potential prognostic and therapeutic values for ESCC patients.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Survivin is an anti-apoptotic protein that is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle in various types of cancers. The current study explored the effect of survivin gene polymorphisms and EGFR mutations in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients. A total of 360 participants, including 291 adenocarcinoma lung cancer and 69 squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer patients, were selected for the analysis of three survivin genetic variants (survivin -31, +9194, and +9809) by using real-time PCR genotyping. The results indicated that GC+CC genotypes of survivin -31 were significant association with EGFR mutation in lung adenocarcinoma patients (adjusted odds ratio=3.498, 95% CI = 1.171-10.448; p&lt;0.01). Moreover, The GC+CC genotypes of survivin -31 were associated with EGFR L858R mutation but not in exon 19 in-frame deletions. Furthermore, among patients in exon 19 in-frame deletions, those who have at least one polymorphic G allele of survivin -31 have an increased incidence to develop late-stage when compared with those patients homozygous for C/C (OR, 4.800; 95% CI, 1.305-17.658). In conclusion, our results showed that survivin genetic variants were related to EGFR mutation in lung adenocarcinoma patients and might contribute to pathological development to NSCLC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: There is accumulating evidence indicating that long non-coding RNA H19 and its mature product miR-675 play essential roles for tumor growth and progression. However, their prognostic value in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particular in laryngeal carcinoma, remains to be elucidated. In this study, we observed that both H19 and miR-675 were significantly overexpressed in a cohort of 65 primary tumor samples and two HNSCC cell lines. Importantly, when paired with patient follow-up data, higher expression of either H19 or miR-675 was significantly correlated with higher risk of patient relapse, and associated with worse overall survival and poor disease-free survival. Knockdown miR-675 caused significant reduction of cell viability, migratory and invasive capabilities. Taken together, these results suggest that the strong correlation of H19 overexpression together with higher miR-675 and lymph node metastases could be useful predictive markers, indicating a potentially therapeutic strategy for HNSCC patients.</text>

<text>Immunohistochemical expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog in histologic gradings of oral squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>120</offset>
<text>CONTEXT: Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 10q23. PTEN has its major function in the regulation of cell adhesion, cell cycle arrest, migration, apoptosis programming, and differentiation. This genomic region suffers loss of heterozygosity in many human cancers. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the immunohistochemical expression of PTEN in normal oral mucosa and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and to correlate the PTEN expression in gradings of OSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty cases of paraffin tissue sections of previously diagnosed OSCC were taken. Of thirty cases, ten were well differentiated, ten were moderately differentiated, and ten were poorly differentiated. As a control, ten paraffin sections of oral normal mucosa tissue specimens were taken from patients undergoing extractions. The sections were stained for immunohistochemical expression of PTEN. The cells stained by PTEN antibody were counted, and an immunohistochemical score was obtained. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical analysis was done using Mann-Whitney's test and Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference between normal mucosa and OSCC in immunohistochemistry staining. However, there was no significant difference in PTEN expression among gradings of OSCC. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that there was a decrease in PTEN expression in OSCC than normal mucosa. It also concluded that PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene which has a wide role in oral carcinogenesis.</text>

<text>Estimation of salivary sialic acid in oral premalignancy and oral squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>90</offset>
<text>AIMS: Oral cancer is the most life-threatening disease of oral tissues. In societies where the incidence of oral cancer is high, clinically recognizable premalignant lesions are particularly common. Diagnosing oral cancers at an early stage is critical in improving the survival rate and reducing the morbidity associated with the disease. Alterations in the sialic acid levels in cancer patients have stimulated interest in this sugar residue as a possible tumor marker. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The purpose of this study was to estimate the salivary sialic acid levels in patients with oral premalignancy and squamous cell carcinoma and to correlate it with their grades to develop a cost-effective and noninvasive diagnostic parameter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unstimulated whole saliva was collected from the groups under study and subjected to biochemical analysis for determination of sialic acid levels. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The salivary sialic acid levels were correlated with the clinical stage and histological grade by one-way ANOVA (SPSS software version 15). RESULTS: Salivary sialic acid was elevated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) compared to oral premalignancy and control group. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the grades of squamous cell carcinoma, grades of dysplasia in premalignancy, and sialic acid level. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Evaluation of salivary sialic acid levels in premalignant and malignant lesions can serve as a screening tool. The mortality and morbidity of OSCC can be reduced if the lesions are diagnosed in early precancerous states using such noninvasive diagnostic methods for screening and monitoring of the population.</text>

We report the clinicopathological features of 86 such tumors, including 74 pleomorphic and 12 spindle cell carcinomas, and propose a novel approach to the classification of these neoplasms in an attempt to better guide patient management. The patients were 47 males and 39 females aged 36 to 87 years (mean, 63 years) who primarily presented with shortness of breath, cough and chest pain. Eighty-six percent of patients had a smoking history. Histologically, the pleomorphic carcinomas consisted of spindle and/or giant cells with varying proportions of conventional non-small cell carcinoma in the form of adenocarcinoma (n=29), squamous cell carcinoma (n=10) or large cell carcinoma (n=18); seventeen cases contained a mix of spindle and giant cells only. The 12 spindle cell carcinomas consisted of spindle cells only. Based on the combined histopathological and immunohistochemical features of these tumors we were able to reanalyze the spectrum of these lesions and reclassify them accordingly. Statistical analysis revealed an overall survival at 3, 5 and 10 years of 42.9%, 34.6% and 23.5%, respectively, and a median survival of 15 months. Log rank test showed that in multivariate analysis only pathological T stage was a factor associated with prognosis. The current classification of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas precludes optimal triaging of these tumors with the risk of denying patients access to novel treatment. Our proposal for a reclassification of these tumors would more accurately guide patient management and facilitate targeted therapies.</text>

<text>Sinonasal papillomas in a private referral otorhinolaryngology centre: Review of 22 years experience.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>101</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical presentation, treatment outcome and follow-up of all patients managed with sinonasal papillomas (SP), at a tertiary private otorhinolaryngology centre in Caracas (Venezuela). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 94 patients with SP that were treated at our otolaryngology center, from July 1st 1993 to June 31st 2015. The demographic data, clinical features, radiological findings, anatomical origin, disease extension into the adjacent structures, surgical approaches performed, histopathology outcomes, recurrent risk, malignant transformation rate and coadjuvant therapies were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients (69.1%) were male and 29 (30.9%) female with an average age of 44.5 years (range 9-80 years). All patients underwent endoscopic sinus surgery. The most commont histologic subtypes of SP were inverted papilloma (58 patients; 61.7%), fungiform papilloma (35 patients; 37.2%) and oncocytic papilloma (one patient; 1.1%). SP was associated in 2 patients with undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Twelve patients (12.8%) had disease with extension beyond the sinus without associated malignancy. All these patients received adjuvant treatment with advanced techniques of radiotherapy. The mean duration of the follow-up period was 9 years and 2 months. Eighteen patients (19.1%) had recurrent disease during the entire course of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Complete endoscopic surgical removal of SP is the treatment of choice. In less endoscopically accessible tumours, with peripheral extension or incompletely resected, Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy may be indicated. Timely post-operative endoscopic follow-up with biopsy of suspected lesions is important for early detection of recurrences and associated malignancy.</text>

<text>Exploring the importance of cancer pathways by meta-analysis of differential protein expression networks in three different cancers.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>132</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: It is believed that all cancers occur due to the mutation or change in one or more genes. In order to investigate the significance of the biological pathways which are interrupted by these genetic mutations, we pursue an integrated analysis using multiple cancer datasets released by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). This dataset consists of expression profiles for genes/proteins of patients receiving treatment, for three types of cancer - Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC), Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC). We consider pathway analysis to identify all the biological pathways which are active among the patients and investigate the roles of the significant pathways using a differential network analysis of the protein expression datasets for the three cancers separately. We then integrate the pathway based results of all the three cancers which provide a more comprehensive picture of the three cancers. RESULTS: From our analysis of the protein expression data, overall, RAS and PI3K signaling pathways appear to play the most significant roles in the three cancers - Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC), Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC). CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that the RAS and PI3K signaling pathways are the two most important pathways in all the three cancers and should be investigated further for their potential roles in cancers.

<text>Cytotoxic and Genotoxic Effects of Electronic Cigarette Liquids on Human Mucosal Tissue Cultures of the Oropharynx.</text>
</passage>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>115</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: The popularity of electronic cigarettes (ECs) is rapidly growing and ECs are claimed to be an uncritically regarded alternative to conventional cigarettes. The mucosal tissue of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) is the first contact organ for xenobiotics such as liquids of ECs. The aim of this study is to investigate the bimolecular effects of e-liquids on human pharyngeal tissue cultures to evaluate whether e-liquids and their components present a risk factor for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Fresh tissue samples of healthy oropharyngeal mucosa were assembled into mucosal tissue cultures. Two fruit-flavored liquids (FLs), one tobacco-flavored liquid (TL) (all containing nicotine), and the corresponding base mixtures (free of nicotine and flavor) were used in three different dilutions. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the water-soluble tetrazolium-8 assay. DNA fragmentation was quantified using alkaline microgel electrophoresis. All liquids caused a significant reduction in cell viability. FLs especially showed a higher toxicity than TL. DNA fragmentation significantly increased by incubation with FL, whereas treatment with TL did not show serious DNA damage. E-liquids are cytotoxic to oropharyngeal tissue, and some liquids can induce relevant DNA damage. Thus, mutagenicity for mucosa of the UADT and e-liquids as risk factors for head and neck cancer cannot entirely be ruled out. Only the implementation of standards and regulations for liquid production and distribution can ensure a valid scientific investigation and assessment of carcinogenic potential of long-term EC use.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is rapidly increasing and the prognosis of patients with metastatic disease is poor. There is an emerging need to identify molecular markers for predicting aggressive behavior of cSCC. Here, we have examined the role of tight junction components in the progression of cSCC. The expression pattern of mRNAs for tight junction components was determined with RNA sequencing and oligonucleotide array-based expression analysis from cSCC cell lines (n=8) and normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK, n=5). The expression of CLDN11 was specifically elevated in primary cSCC cell lines (n=5), but low or absent in metastatic cSCC cell lines (n=3) and NHEKs. Claudin-11 was detected in cell-cell contacts of primary cSCC cells in culture by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. Analysis of a large panel of tissue samples from sporadic UV-induced cSCC (n=65), cSCC in situ (n=56), actinic keratoses (n=31), seborrheic keratoses (n=7), and normal skin (n=16) by immunohistochemistry showed specific staining for claudin-11 in intercellular junctions of keratinizing tumor cells in well and moderately differentiated cSCCs, whereas no staining for claudin-11 was detected in poorly differentiated tumors. The expression of claudin-11 in cSCC cells was dependent on the activity of p38   MAPK and knockdown of claudin-11 enhanced cSCC cell invasion. These findings provide evidence for the role of claudin-11 in regulation of cSCC invasion and suggest loss of claudin-11 expression in tumor cells as a biomarker for advanced stage of cSCC.

<text>UNASSIGNED: To study ROCK2 activation in carcinogenesis, mice expressing 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT)-activated ROCK2 (K14.ROCK(er)) were crossed with mice expressing epidermal-activated ras(Ha) (HK1.ras(1205)). At 8 weeks, 4HT-treated K14.ROCK(er)/HK1.ras(1205) cohorts exhibited papillomas similar to HK1.ras(1205) controls; however, K14.ROCK(er)/HK1.ras(1205) histotypes comprised a mixed papilloma/well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (wdSCC), exhibiting p53 loss, increased proliferation and novel NF-kB expression. By 12 weeks, K14.ROCK(er)/HK1.ras(1205) wdSCCs exhibited increased NF-kB and novel tenascin C, indicative of elevated rigidity; yet despite continued ROCK2 activities/p-Mypt1 inactivation, progression to SCC required loss of compensatory p21 expression. K14.ROCK(er)/HK1.ras(1205) papillomatogenesis also required a wound promotion stimulus, confirmed by breeding K14.ROCK(er) into promotion-insensitive HK1.ras(1276) mice, suggesting a permissive K14.ROCK(er)/HK1.ras(1205) papilloma context (wound-promoted/NF-kB(+)/p53(-)/p21(+)) preceded K14.ROCK(er)-mediated (p-Mypt1/tenascin C/rigidity) malignant conversion. Malignancy depended on ROCK(er)/p-Mypt1 expression, as cessation of 4HT treatment induced disorganized tissue architecture and p21-associated differentiation in wdSCCs; yet tenascin C retention in connective tissue extracellular matrix suggests the rigidity laid down for conversion persists. Novel papilloma outgrowths appeared expressing intense, basal layer p21 that confined endogenous ROCK2/p-Mypt1/NF-kB to supra-basal layers, and was paralleled by restored basal layer p53. In later SCCs, 4HT cessation became irrelevant as endogenous ROCK2 expression increased, driving progression via p21 loss, elevated NF-kB expression and tenascin C-associated rigidity, with p-Mypt1 inactivation/actinomyosin-mediated contractility to facilitate invasion. However, p21-associated inhibition of early-stage malignant progression and the intense expression in papilloma outgrowths, identifies a novel, significant antagonism between p21 and ras(Ha)/ROCK2/NF-kB signalling in skin carcinogenesis. Collectively, these data show that ROCK2 activation induces malignancy in ras(Ha)-initiated/promoted papillomas in the context of p53 loss and novel NF-kB expression, whereas increased tissue rigidity and cell motility/contractility help mediate tumour progression.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 December 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.402.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) may present with or without the feature of acantholysis. METHOD: Investigate invasive acantholytic SCC by microscopic maximum tumor surface diameter, depth of invasion, grade of differentiation, perineural invasion (PNI) and percentage of acantholysis. Assess recurrence following excision. RESULTS: A total of 1,658 consecutive invasive SCC cases were examined, comprising 4.9% acantholytic SCC. Median tumor microscopic maximum diameter was 8   mm for acantholytic SCC and 7.3   mm for non-acantholytic SCC. Median tumor invasion depth was 1.0   mm for acantholytic SCC and 1.5   mm for non-acantholytic SCC. Well, moderate and poor differentiation were not significantly different between acantholytic SCC and non-acantholytic SCC. One PNI case was found in 82 acantholytic SCC cases. A total of 77 acantholytic SCC cases were followed up over a median 25 months finding histologic proven recurrence at three acantholytic SCC excision sites. CONCLUSIONS: Acantholytic SCC were more likely to be located on head sites with less median depth than non-acantholytic SCC. Increasing percentage of acantholysis within acantholytic SCC was not associated with a shift towards poor differentiation. Histologic margins of 1.2   mm may adequately excise small acantholytic SCC. No recorded deaths, low PNI and low recurrence rates suggests acantholytic SCC is low-risk.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: RNA-binding protein with serine-rich domain 1 (RNPS1) is a component of pre-splicing and post-splicing multiprotein complexes, which activates constitutive and alternative splicing. RNPS1 participates in the formation of the spliceosome and activates the pre-mRNA splicing process. In the present study, we found that ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4) is a binding partner of RNPS1. Although RNPS1 is polyubiquitinated by both K48- and K63-linkages, USP4 exclusively deubiquitinates K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of RNPS1. We also demonstrate that the catalytic activity of USP4 on ubiquitinated RNPS1 is elevated by squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells 3 (Sart3).</text>

<text>Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma masquerading as large pyogenic granuloma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>90</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) forms 9% of the cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. It usually presents as solitary reddish brown ulcerating nodule or indurated plaque. Sometimes, it mimics other dermatological diseases such as eczema, pyoderma gangrenosum, pyogenic granuloma, morphea, and squamous cell carcinoma. Our case presented with large pyogenic granuloma like lesion with regional lymphadenopathy. Since pcALCL is rare, one can misdiagnose such cases and therefore high index of suspicion is necessary.</text>

<text>Advanced diffusion models in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients: Goodness of fit, relationships among diffusion parameters and comparison with dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>191</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: We assessed advanced fitting models of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in head/neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients to determine the best goodness of fit and correlations among diffusion parameters. We compared these results with those of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 32 HNSCC patients (12 sinonasal, 20 pharynx/oral cavity). The DWI acquisition used single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) with 12 b-values (0-2000). We calculated 14 DWI parameters using mono-exponential, bi-exponential, and tri-exponential models, stretched exponential model (SEM) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) models. We compared each model's goodness of fit using the residual sum of squares (RSS), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) value. We determined the correlation between each pair of DWI parameters and between each DWI parameter and DCE perfusion parameter. RESULTS: The tri-exponential fit's RSS, AIC and BIC values were significantly smaller than those for bi-exponential fit. The RSS, AIC and BIC values of the SEM fit and DKI fit were significantly smaller than mono-exponential model. Significant correlations were observed in 30 pairs (sinonasal cavity) and 31 (sinonasal cavity group) among 91 DWI parameter combinations. Significant correlations were also observed in nine pairs (both sinonasal cavity and pharynx/oral cavity group) among 64 DWI/DCE perfusion parameter pairs, in particular, high positive correlations between the tri-exponential model's intermediate diffusion fraction (f2) and the volume of the extracellular extravascular space per unit volume of tissue (ve) were observed in both patient groups. CONCLUSION: We identified several correlations between DWI parameters by advanced fitting models and correlations between DWI and DCE parameters. These will help determine HNSCC patients' detailed tissue structures.</text>

<text>Head and neck nonmelanoma cutaneous malignancy treatment in a skin cancer referral center.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>90</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to determine the level of accuracy provided by clinical diagnosis in head and neck cutaneous malignancy as confirmed by histopathologic examination of the specimen in a skin cancer referral center. Positive predictive value was selected as a reliable measure of diagnostic accuracy. We also aimed to audit our surgical outcomes and record and present the completeness of excision, the rates of recurrence and metastasis, and the reconstructive method. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the electronic charts of 867 consecutive patients with skin tumors and calculated the positive and negative predictive values of clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: The positive predictive value was 91% for basal cell carcinoma and 78.8% for squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 178 histologically diagnosed squamous cell carcinomas, 15 were metastatic. CONCLUSIONS: In a skin cancer referral center, expert clinical diagnosis may safely overcome the need for preoperative biopsy. Relying on clinical diagnosis to formalize a treatment plan for head and neck nonmelanoma skin cancer is safe and efficient. This is more reliable in cases of basal cell carcinoma compared with suspected squamous cell carcinomas.</text>

<text>AIM: The purpose of the present study was to find out the expression of p53, transforming growth factor-b TGF-b), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), proteins implicated in its pathophysiology, as well as malignant transformation. We also sought to determine the effect of curcumin on the expression of these markers through immunohistochemistry. METHODS: The expression of p53, TGF-b, and iNOS was evaluated through immunohistochemistry in 28 patients with OSMF before and after treatment with curcumin. Expression was evaluated semiquantitatively using a four-point scale based on the percentage of cells showing positive staining. RESULTS: The expression of p53, TGF-b, and iNOS in OSMF was found to be statistically significant (P&lt;.05). After therapy with curcumin, a decrease in the expression of p53, TGF-b, and iNOS was seen in 25%, 32.1%, and 32.1% of the samples, respectively; however, the difference in pretreatment and post-treatment expressions was not found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The present finding suggest that curcumin could have an effect on the expression of p53, iNOS, and TGF-b in OSMF, and thus, could prove to be an effective chemopreventive agent for its management. The increased expression of p53, TGF-b, and iNOS in OSMF is suggestive of the role of these markers in its pathophysiology.</text>

<text>microRNA from brush biopsy to characterize oral squamous cell carcinoma epithelium.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>83</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Few cancers are diagnosed based on RNA expression signatures. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is no exception; it is currently diagnosed by scalpel biopsy followed by histopathology. This study sought to identify oral tumor epithelial microRNA (miRNA) expression changes to determine if these changes could be used to diagnose the disease noninvasively. Analysis of miRNA profiles from surgically obtained OSCC tissue, collected under highly standardized conditions for The Cancer Genome Atlas, was done to determine the potential accuracy in differentiating tumor from normal mucosal tissue. Even when using small 20 subject datasets, classification based on miRNA was 90 to 100% accurate. To develop a noninvasive classifier for OSSC, analysis of brush biopsy miRNA was done and showed 87% accuracy in differentiating tumor from normal epithelium when using RT-qPCR or miRNAseq to measure miRNAs. An extensive overlap was seen in differentially expressed miRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma epithelium obtained using brush biopsy and those reported in saliva and serum of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients in several studies. This suggested that nonselective release of these miRNAs into body fluids from tumor epithelium was largely responsible for the changes in levels in these fluids seen with this disease. Using a variation in mirRPath we identified the KEGG pathway of neurotrophin signaling as a target of these miRNAs disregulated in tumor epithelium. This highlights the utility of brush biopsy of oral mucosa to allow simple acquisition of cancer relevant miRNA information from tumor epithelium.</text>

<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>141</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to assess oncologic and functional outcome in primary total laryngectomy or pharyngolaryngectomy (TL/TL/TPL) for laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer with extra-laryngeal extension (T4) and to determine the predictive factors of these results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the computerized medical records of all patients undergoing primary TL/TPL for T4 larynx or hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma between 2000 and 2014 at our institution. Predictive factors of oncologic and functional outcome were investigated on univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients (58  men, 5  women; mean age, 68.8  9.7  years) were included. Overall and disease-specific survivals were 69% and 80% at 3  years, and 56% and 69% at 5  years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, gender (female, P&lt;0.001), ASA score (ASA&gt;= 3; P=0.006) and vascular embolism (P=0.006) had significant pejorative impact on overall survival. Six months after end of treatment, 90% of patients had recovered independent oral feeding and 83% of those with tracheoesophageal voice prostheses had recovered an intelligible voice. CONCLUSION: Primary TL/TPL remains the gold standard treatment for T4 larynx or hypopharynx cancer. It provides satisfactory oncologic and functional outcomes.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) have molecular characterization and most druggable genetic and molecular abnormalities, such as EGFR, ERBB2 and BRAF mutations, and ALK and ROS1 rearrangements, have been observed in a subset of adenocarcinomas or large cell carcinomas [1]. Even if these abnormalities are seldom detected in squamous cell carcinomas (SQCC), some rare cases of SQCC have been reported to harbor EGFR, ROS1 or ALK genetic alterations with in some cases a response to targeted therapies [2,3]. Here, we describe a patient with a SQCC harboring ROS1 rearrangement and a response to the target therapy, crizotinib.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Although improvement in both surgical techniques and neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been achieved, the 5-year survival rate of locally advanced tumors was, at best, still 55%. Therefore, elucidation of mechanisms of the malignancy is eagerly awaited. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) has been reported to have critical biological roles for cancer cell stemness, whereas little is known about it in ESCC. In current study, a transcriptional factor SIX1 was found to be aberrantly expressed in ESCCs. SIX1 cDNA transfection induced overexpression of transforming growth factors (TGFB1 and TGFB2) and its receptor (TGFBR2). Cell invasion was reduced by SIX1 knockdown and was increased in stable SIX1-transfectants. Furthermore, the SIX1-transfectants highly expressed tumor basal cell markers such as NGFR, SOX2, ALDH1A1, and PDPN. Although mock-transfectants had only a 20% PDPN-high population, SIX1-transfectants had 60-70%. In two sets of 42 and 85 ESCC patients received by surgery alone or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, the cases with high SIX1 mRNA and protein expression level significantly showed a poor prognosis compared with those with low. These SIX1 high cases also expressed the above basal cell markers, but suppressed the differentiation markers. Finally, TGF-b signaling blockade suppressed ESCC cell growth in association with the reduction of PDPN-positive tumor basal cell population. The present results suggest that SIX1 accelerates self-renewal of tumor basal cells, resulting in a poor prognosis for ESCC patients. This article is protected by copyright.

<text>BACKGROUND: Traditionally, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung is a central rather than a peripheral form of lung cancer. Rates of SCC in the lung periphery are typically sited in the 15-30% range. Recently, we observed that a significant portion of newly diagnosed SCC was located on a periphery. A comprehensive review of the tumor data at our facility, a busy teaching hospital with a large cohort of cancer patients, was undertaken to assess whether there had been a substantive change in the traditional epidemiologic distributions of the lung cancer, specifically with respect to SCC. Given the differences in cell biology and carcinogenesis of central versus peripheral SCC, a potential epidemiologic shift might suggest a change in tumor biology. METHODS: From May 12, 2012 through May 13, 2013, all histopathologically confirmed diagnoses of SCC of the lung were retrospectively reviewed. Each patient's lesion was then classified as peripheral or central based on CT evidence. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were diagnosed with SCC. Of these, 55% (n=31) had peripheral and 45% (n=25) had central SCC. Twenty-nine patients did not have any prior history of malignancy. Of this subset of patients, 62% (n=18) had peripheral SCC, and 38% (n=11) had central SCC. CONCLUSION: Our findings appear to correlate with our initial observation that, within our institution, there has been a substantive shift in the traditional distribution of SCC with the majority of these cancers now being diagnosed in the lung periphery as opposed to the more central locations.</text>

<text>Survival prognostic factors for metachronous second primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>

<offset>98</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: We examined the overall survival rates of a national cohort to determine optimal treatments and prognostic factors for patients with metachronous second primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (mspHNSCCs) at different stages and sites. We analyzed data of mspHNSCC patients collected from the Taiwan Cancer Registry database. The patients were categorized into four groups based on the treatment modality: Group 1 (control arm; chemotherapy [CT] alone), Group 2 (reirradiation [re-RT] alone with intensity-modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]), Group 3 (concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone [irradiation with IMRT]), and Group 4 (salvage surgery with or without RT or CT). We enrolled 1741 mspHNSCC patients without distant metastasis. Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) &gt;= 6, stage of second HNSCC, stage of first HNSCC, and duration from first primary HNSCC of &lt;3  years were significant poor independent prognostic risk factors for overall survival. After adjustment, adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the overall all-cause mortality risk at mspHNSCC clinical stages III and IV were 0.72 (0.40-1.82), 0.52 (0.35-0.75), and 0.32 (0.22-0.45) in Groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively. A Cox regression analysis indicated that a re-RT dose of &gt;= 6000 cGy was an independent protective prognostic factor for treatment modalities. CCI  &gt;=   6, stage of second HNSCC, stage of first HNSCC, and duration from first primary HNSCC of &lt;3  years were significant poor independent prognostic risk factors for overall survival. A re-RT dose of &gt;= 6000 cGy may be necessary for mspHNSCCs.</text>

<text>Imaging of palatal lumps.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>25</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Palatal tumours are relatively rare and of variable aetiology, rendering radiological evaluation a daunting process for many. A systematic approach to the imaging of a palatal lump is therefore essential. The hard and soft palates are oral cavity and oropharyngeal structures, respectively. They have different tissue compositions, and therefore, lesions occur with different frequencies at each site. The hard palate has the highest concentration of minor salivary glands in the upper aerodigestive tract and most tumours here are salivary in origin, whereas most tumours at the soft palate are epithelial in origin, i.e., squamous cell carcinomas, in line with other oropharyngeal subsites. The most common malignant tumours of the palate, after squamous cell carcinoma, are minor salivary gland tumours, predominantly adenoid cystic and mucoepidermoid carcinomas. These tumours have a propensity to spread perineurally; understanding the anatomy and imaging features of perineural spread is vital, as it can have significant implications for patient management and tumour resectability. When confronted with a palatal lump, it is important to consider the following: its location on the hard or soft palate; whether it is mucosal or submucosal; the frequently occurring lesions at that site; the most suitable imaging techniques (ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging); whether there are typical imaging features for any of the common lesions; and whether there are aggressive features, such as bone erosion or perineural spread. This approach allows the radiologist to narrow the differential diagnosis and assist the clinicians with planning treatment.</text>

<text>The toxicity and efficacy of concomitant chemoradiotherapy in patients aged 70 years and older with oropharyngeal carcinoma in the intensity-modulated radiotherapy era.</text>
</passage>

<offset>168</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Despite controversy surrounding its benefit, the use of concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) who are aged   &gt;   70 years is increasing. However, to the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have compared the outcomes of different systemic treatments in this population. METHODS: Records from 74 patients aged   &gt;=    70 years with stage III to stage IVB OPSCC who were undergoing CCRT from 2002 to 2013 at a single institution were reviewed. Patients were stratified according to the systemic therapy received, including cisplatin, carboplatin with either 5-fluorouracil or paclitaxel (CARB), or cetuximab to compare oncologic outcome and toxicity. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 36 months. The median age of the patients was 75.3 years (range, 70-91 years), with significantly older patients receiving cetuximab (P   =   .03). A total of 28, 20, and 26 patients, respectively, received CCRT with cisplatin, CARB, and cetuximab. RT interruptions of   &gt;   1 day were needed in 4% of patients receiving cisplatin, 20% of patients receiving CARB, and 15% of patients receiving cetuximab (P   =   .19). Unplanned hospitalizations during CCRT occurred in 25%, 55%, and 58%, respectively, of patients receiving cisplatin, CARB, and cetuximab (P   =   .03). There were 2 treatment-related deaths, both of which occurred among the patients who were treated with cetuximab. At 5 years, locoregional control was achieved in 100%, 88%, and 60% (P&lt;.001), respectively, and the overall survival rate was 87%, 61%, and 47% (P   =   .03), respectively, among patients treated with cisplatin, CARB, and cetuximab. CONCLUSIONS: Toxicity from CCRT remains a challenge for older adults with OPSCC. Herein, the authors found no evidence that this toxicity was mitigated by treatment with cetuximab. Nevertheless, a subset of patients aged &gt;= 70 years appear to tolerate cisplatin-based treatment with acceptable toxicity and excellent outcomes. Further identification of this patient subgroup is crucial to optimize therapy for older patients with OPSCC. Cancer 2016.    2016 American Cancer Society.</text>

<text>Tissue Fluorescence Imaging (VELscope) for Quick Non-Invasive Diagnosis in Oral Pathology.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>90</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral squamous cell carcinoma is the most common form of malignancy of the oral cavity; its incidence is increasing and late-stage presentation is common. It is usually predated by oral premalignant disorders. For this reason, early diagnosis is fundamental to reduce the malignant transformation of oral premalignant disorders and for increase the survival rate for oral cancer. Scraping the surface of the lesion is useful for having cytological features of the investigated tissue. The features of smears of oral premalignant lesions are the keratinization growth (red, orange, brown), the increased nuclear area and so the nuclear hyperchromatism, the nuclear pleomorphism, and the chromatin clumping. All those features are essential for doing the right diagnosis. However, the oral disease should be recognized at the first view by the clinical investigation without touching the lesions avoiding possible alteration in the cells of the tissue. The current standard of incisional biopsy with histology is painful for patients and involves a delay, although histology is completed. The aim of this article is to evaluate the effectiveness of other available tests that are unobtrusive and provide immediate results like the tissue fluorescence imaging.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognosis and recurrence of microinvasive squamous cervical (MIC) cancer stage IA1 in women treated conservatively or by hysterectomy, and followed-up to 20 years. METHODS: It was studied in a cohort of 139 women with MIC, 41 definitively managed by conization and 98 by hysterectomy from January 1994 to December 2003 and followed-up until 2013. The definitive treatment, age, conization technique (loop electrosurgical excision procedure or cold knife conization), cone margin, residual disease in hysterectomy specimen, and the association with recurrence (intraepithelial cervical neoplasia grade 3/intraepithelial vaginal neoplasia grade 3 or worse, and microinvasive or worse) were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 2.5 times more conservative treatment in younger women than older (&gt;40 years), and high proportion of residual disease in hysterectomy specimens (67% of intraepithelial cervical neoplasia grade 3 or worse), more common if positive cone margin (74% vs 35%, P &lt; 0.002). There were 2.3% (3/133) recurrences detected as microinvasive or worse, and 6% (8/133) recurrences detected as intraepithelial cervical neoplasia grade 3/intraepithelial vaginal neoplasia grade 3 or worse: 7.3% (3/41) in the conization group and 5.4% (5/92) in the hysterectomy group (P = 0.701). Almost all recurrences (88%, 7/8) were diagnosed until 36 months after treatment, and they were not associated with conization technique. There were no differences in risk of recurrence and overall disease-free survival time related to type of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the good prognosis of MIC, regardless the treatment. When fertility is not a concern, hysterectomy should be considered as definitive treatment to avoid the risk of residual disease. Regular follow-up for a long period should be maintained.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVE: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), and SRSF3 are splicing regulators associated with oncogenesis. However, the alterations of SF proteins and their diagnostic values in cervical cancer are unclear. To apply SFs clinically, effective marker selection and characterization of the target organ properties are essential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We concurrently analyzed HNRNPA1, SRSF1, SRSF3, and the conventional tumor markers squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in cervical tissue samples (n = 127) using semiquantitative immunoblotting. In addition, we compared them with p16 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A [CDKN2A]), which has shown high diagnostic efficacy in immunohistochemical staining studies and has been proposed as a candidate protein for point-of-care screening biochemical tests of cervical neoplasia. RESULTS: HNRNPA1, higher molecular weight forms of SRSF1 (SRSF1-HMws), SRSF3, CEA, and p16 levels were higher (P &lt; 0.05) in cervical carcinoma tissue samples than in nontumoral cervical tissue samples. However, the levels of SRSF1-Total (sum of SRSF1-HMws and a lower molecular weight form of SRSF1) and SCCA, a commonly used cervical tumor marker, were not different between carcinoma and nontumoral tissue samples. In paired sample comparisons, HNRNPA1 (94%) showed the highest incidence of up-regulation (carcinoma/nontumor, &gt;1.5) in cervical carcinoma, followed by p16 (84%), SRSF1-HMws (69%), SRSF3 (66%), CEA (66 %), SCCA (32%), and SRSF1-Total (31%). HNRNPA1 (92%) and p16 (91%) presented the two highest diagnostic accuracies for cervical carcinoma, which were superior to those of SRSF3 (75%), SRSF1-HMws (72%), CEA (72%), SCCA (59%), and SRSF1-Total (55%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified that HNRNPA1 is the best diagnostic marker among the SFs and conventional markers given its excellent diagnostic efficacy for cervical carcinoma, and it has a p16-comparable diagnostic value. We suggest that HNRNPA1 is an additional effective target protein for developing cervical cancer detection tools.</text>

<text>INTRODUCTION: Multiple techniques have been used for reconstruction of large defects of the lower lip. However, some complications, such as microstomia, distortion of oral commissure, lip functional problems, and sensory loss might occur with these techniques. The aim of this work is to evaluate a new method of reconstruction of large lower lip defects after excision of squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with lower lip squamous cell carcinomas were managed with this new technique of reconstruction using dermal fat flap, mucobuccal flap, and muscle transfer after excision of the tumor with 1-cm safety margin on both sides. The functional and aesthetic assessments were performed at least 6 months after surgery, and the results were compared statistically with a control group. RESULTS: Of the 18 patients, sensibility was normal in 16 (89%) and complete competence was determined in all cases (100%). In 17 patients (94%), complete and symmetric pouting and mouth-opening movements were ensured. Interlabial measurements would be better in all patients. Nasolabial asymmetry was detected in 1 patient (6%) and apparent mentolabial scar tissue was detected in 2 patients (11%). The new vermilion was of equal width to the upper lip vermilion in 15 patients (83%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, this technique could be considered a good choice for repair of major lip defects. In addition, using this technique will give good aesthetic and functional results.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor gene involved in regulation of the cell cycle, cellular differentiation, repair of DNA damage and apoptosis. In the distinction of malignant mesothelioma from benign mesothelial proliferations, immunohistochemical loss of BAP1, the protein expressed by the BAP1 gene, has proven highly specific for malignant mesothelioma. However, few studies have investigated the rate of BAP1 loss in tumors that commonly metastasize to the pleura. Our objective is to determine the rate of BAP1 loss in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Immunohistochemistry for BAP1 was performed using tissue microarrays containing 133 confirmed cases of NSCLC (80 of lung adenocarcinoma and 53 of squamous cell carcinoma). Cases were interpreted as showing BAP1 loss if nuclear staining was completely absent in all tumor cells and present in stromal and inflammatory cells that served as internal controls. Cases showing no BAP1 staining in the internal controls were excluded. After exclusion of 32 cases for technical reasons, only one case of pulmonary adenocarcinoma out 101 cases of NSCLC (69 adenocarcinoma and 32 squamous cell carcinoma, 1.0% of cases) showed BAP1 loss. We conclude that loss of BAP1 expression is a rare event in NSCLC. Therefore, BAP1 is a potentially useful addition to the immunohistochemical markers used to distinguish mesothelioma from pleural metastasis of NSCLC.</text>

<text>Clinical significance of circulating tumor cells in squamous cell lung cancer patients.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>87</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung represents 20-30% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and is associated with a poor prognosis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in squamous cell lung cancer patients and what its role might be in providing prognostic information. METHODS: Serial blood samples from 100 patients both before and after initiation of one cycle of standard chemotherapy were analyzed using CellSearch system. RESULTS: Of 105 patients enrolled, 100 were evaluable. &gt;=  2 CTCs per 7.5 mL of blood were present in 29% of patients at baseline before chemotherapy, and 9% patients have more than 5 CTCs. Based on the current literature, the CTC measurements were dichotomized as 2-4 versus &gt;=  5 CTCs. In the univariate analysis, CTC count &gt;=  5 at baseline and CTC count &gt;=  5 at both time points (before and after one cycle of chemotherapy) were significantly associated with a poor PFS and OS outcome. Both factors remained independent poor prognostic markers in the stepwise multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our study indicate that the CTC count is a prognostic factor for PFS and OS outcomes in Chinese patients with locally advanced SCC of the lung.</text>

<text>Oral Adenosquamous Carcinoma Mimicking a Pyogenic Granuloma: a Challenging Diagnosis.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>85</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Adenosquamous carcinoma is an aggressive variant of squamous cell carcinoma. This report describes a case of adenosquamous carcinoma with clinical features of a benign lesion and discusses the differential diagnoses, especially regarding histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. A 45-year-old male was referred to our outpatient clinic complaining about a rapid-growing enlargement in hard palate. Clinical examination revealed an erythematous and pedunculated nodule with lobulated non-ulcerated surface. Excisional biopsy was performed following clinical diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma. Histologically, the specimen consisted of areas characterizing both well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and true adenocarcinoma. After a broad list of immunohistochemical markers was evaluated (AE1/AE3, CEA, CK5, CK7, CK8/18, p53, p63 and Ki67), the diagnosis of adenosquamous carcinoma was rendered and the patient referred to complementary surgery. Adenosquamous carcinoma represents a challenge in diagnostic routine due to its rarity, diverse range of clinical presentations and histological features. Furthermore, classical clinical benign features may be present in malignant lesions; hence the submission of every surgical specimen to histological analysis is mandatory to provide the patient the adequate treatment.</text>

<text>Squamous Cell Carcinoma Arising in Background of Mature Cystic Teratoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>72</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Mature cystic teratoma of ovary is a common benign adnexal tumor in females. Malignant transformation in a mature cystic teratoma of the ovary occurs in only 1 - 2% of cases. Most common malignant transformation is squamous cell carcinoma (70-80% of cases), occurring mostly in postmenopausal women with large sized cysts. Here, we report a case of 46-year lady who presented with pain in lower abdomen. Ultrasound and CT scan revealed complex adnexal mass measuring 16x9 cm. Size and older age of the patients should be regarded as important predictors of malignant transformation in mature cystic teratoma. Adequate sampling followed by histopathological examination has important role in diagnosis of such rare tumor.</text>

<text>Understanding molecular markers in recurrent oral squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiation.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>102</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: Oral cancer accounts for approximately 2.1% of all cancers worldwide. In India, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common cancer with half a million new cases diagnosed every year. More than 50% of patients eventually develop local recurrence or metastasis usually within the first 2-years following completion of treatment. It is beneficial to analyze the prognostic significance of Cyclin D1, p53 and EGFR which are critical mediators in the pathogenesis of OSCC. The objective of this study was to assess the association of expression of these markers with recurrence and pattern of recurrence in OSCC patients undergoing chemoradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Total 290 OSCC cases of locally advanced stage (III, IV) oral cancer with World Health Organization (W.H.O.) performance status of grade 0/1 in the year 2009-2012 were enrolled in the study. Treatment response was assessed according to W.H.O. criteria. Cyclin D1, EGFR and p53 expression in tumor tissue was estimated by immunohistochemical (IHC) method and quantified as percentage positive nuclei. RESULTS: During the 2-years follow up, 56 (19.3%) patients recurred, out of which, 47 (83.9%) were locoregional and 9 (16.1%) distant sites. On correlating,   (2) test showed significant (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.001) association of marker expressions (Cyclin D1, EGFR and p53) with recurrence. The strong positive expressions of all three markers showed significant association with early time of recurrence. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed significant (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.001) association of recurrence with primary site, differentiation, Cyclin D1 and p53 expressions indicating these as an independent predictors of recurrence in OSCC. The Cyclin D1, EGFR and p53 expressions also showed significant (P &lt; 0.001) poor survivals (OS, DFS and RFS) in patients with positive/strong positive expressions than negative expression suggesting their prognosis in OSCC. CONCLUSION: Our results signifies that tumors over expressing Cyclin D1, EGFR and p53 are resistant to chemoradiation and are associated with increased risk of locoregional recurrence and metastasis in OSCC patients undergoing chemoradiation.</text>

</passage>
<passage>

<offset>87</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Actinic cheilitis (AC) is a disease caused by prolonged and cumulative sun exposure that mostly affects the lower lip, which can progress to a lip squamous cell carcinoma. Routine diagnosis relies on clinician experience and training. We investigated the diagnostic efficacy of wide-field fluorescence imaging coupled to an automated algorithm for AC recognition. Fluorescence images were acquired from 57 patients with confirmed AC and 46 normal volunteers. Three different algorithms were employed: two based on the emission characteristics of local heterogeneity, entropy and intensity range, and one based on the number of objects after K-mean clustering. A classification model was obtained using a fivefold cross correlation algorithm. Sensitivity and specificity rates were 86% and 89.1%, respectively.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are related to different biological processes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of the long noncoding RNA HOXA11-AS (HOXA11 antisense RNA) in NSCLC are unknown. METHODS: HOXA11-AS was knocked down in the NSCLC A549 cell line and a high throughput microarray assay was applied to detect changes in the gene profiles of the A549 cells. Bioinformatics analyses (gene ontology (GO), pathway, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and network analyses) were performed to investigate the potential pathways and networks of the differentially expressed genes. The molecular signatures database (MSigDB) was used to display the expression profiles of these differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, the relationships between the HOXA11-AS, de-regulated genes and clinical NSCLC parameters were verified by using NSCLC patient information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, the relationship between HOXA11-AS expression and clinical diagnostic value was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Among the differentially expressed genes, 277 and 80 genes were upregulated and downregulated in NSCLC, respectively (fold change  &gt;= 2.0, P  &lt;  0.05 and false discovery rate (FDR)  &lt;  0.05). According to the degree of the fold change, six upregulated and three downregulated genes were selected for further investigation. Only four genes (RSPO3, ADAMTS8, DMBT1, and DOCK8) were reported to be related with the development or progression of NSCLC based on a PubMed search. Among all possible pathways, three pathways (the PI3K-Akt, TGF-beta and Hippo signaling pathways) were the most likely to be involved in NSCLC development and progression. Furthermore, we found that HOXA11-AS was highly expressed in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma based on TCGA database. The ROC curve showed that the area under curve (AUC) of HOXA11-AS was 0.727 (95% CI 0.663-0.790) for lung adenocarcinoma and 0.933 (95% CI 0.906-0.960) for squamous cell carcinoma patients. Additionally, the original data from TCGA verified that ADAMTS8, DMBT1 and DOCK8 were downregulated in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, whereas RSPO3 expression was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and downregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma. For the other five genes (STMN2, SPINK6, TUSC3, LOC100128054, and C8orf22), we found that STMN2, TUSC3 and C8orf22 were upregulated in squamous cell carcinoma and that STMN2 and USC3 were upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, we compared the correlation between HOXA11-AS and de-regulated genes in NSCLC based on TCGA. The results showed that the HOXA11-AS expression was negatively correlated with DOCK8 in squamous cell carcinoma (r  =  -0.124, P  =  0.048) and lung adenocarcinoma (r  =  -0.176, P  =  0.005). In addition, RSPO3, ADAMTS8 and DOCK8 were related to overall survival and disease-free survival (all P  &lt;  0.05) of lung adenocarcinoma patients in TCGA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the gene profiles were significantly changed after HOXA11-AS knock-down in NSCLC cells. We speculated that HOXA11-AS may play an important role in NSCLC development and progression by regulating the expression of various pathways and genes, especially DOCK8 and TGF-beta pathway. However, the exact mechanism should be verified by functional experiments.</text>

<text>Meta-analysis Exploring the Effectiveness of S-1-Based Chemotherapy for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.</text>
</passage>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>108</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: S-1 is a new oral fluoropyrimidine formulation that comprises tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine, and potassium oxonate. S-1 is designed to enhance antitumor activity and to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity. Several studies have demonstrated that both S-1 monotherapy and S-1 combination regimens showed encouraging efficacies and mild toxicities in the treatment of lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. However, it is unclear whether S-1 can be used as standard care in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of S-1-based chemotherapy, compared with standard chemotherapy, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2,134 patients with a similar ratio of different pathological types were included. In first-line or second-line chemotherapy, compared with standard chemotherapy, S-1-based chemotherapy showed similar efficacy in terms of median overall survival (mOS), median progression free survival (mPFS), and objective response rate (ORR) (all P &gt; 0.1), and significantly reduced the incidence of grade &gt;=  3 hematological toxicities. In patients with locally advanced NSCLC receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy, compared with standard chemoradiotherapy, significantly improved survival in the S-1-based chemotherapy was noted in terms of mOS and mPFS (risk radio [RR] = 1.289, P = 0.009; RR = 1.289, P = 0.000, respectively) with lower incidence of grade &gt;=  3 neutropenia (RR = 0.453, P = 0.000). The present meta-analysis demonstrates that S-1-based chemotherapy shows similar benefits in advanced NSCLC and improves survival in locally advanced NSCLC, compared with standard treatment.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Patients with advanced stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are often treated with cisplatin-containing chemoradiation protocols. Although cisplatin is an effective radiation sensitizer, it causes severe toxicity and not all patients benefit from the combination treatment. HNSCCs expectantly not responding to cisplatin may better be treated with surgery and postoperative radiation or cetuximab and radiation, but biomarkers to personalize chemoradiotherapy, are not available. We performed an unbiased genome-wide functional genetic screen in vitro to identify genes that influence the response to cisplatin in HNSCC cells. By siRNA-mediated knockdown, we identified the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway as the predominant pathway for cisplatin response in HNSCC cells. We also identified the involvement of the SHFM1 gene in the process of DNA cross-link repair. Furthermore, expression profiles based on these genes predict prognosis of radiation and chemoradiation treated head and neck cancer patients. This genome-wide functional analysis designated the genes that are important in the response of HNSCC to cisplatin and may guide further biomarker validation. Cisplatin imaging as well as biomarkers that indicate the activity of the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway in the tumors are the prime candidates.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Loss of argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), a key enzyme for arginine synthesis, occurs in many cancers, making cells dependent on extracellular arginine and targetable by the arginine-degrading enzyme pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG 20). We evaluated ASS1 expression and effects of ASS1 loss in bladder cancer which, despite affecting &gt;70,000 people in the United States annually, has limited therapies. ASS1 loss was identified in conventional and micropapillary urothelial carcinoma, small cell, and squamous cell carcinoma subtypes of invasive bladder cancer, as well as in T24, J82, and UM-UC-3 but not in 5637, RT112, and RT4 cell lines. ASS1-deficient cells showed preferential sensitivity to ADI-PEG 20, evidenced by decreased colony formation, reduced cell viability, and increased sub-G1 fractions. ADI-PEG 20 induced general control nonderepressible 2-dependent eukaryotic initiation factor 2a phosphorylation and activating transcription factor 4 and C/EBP homologous protein up-regulation, associated with caspase-independent apoptosis and autophagy. These effects were ablated with selective siRNA silencing of these proteins. ASS1 overexpression in UM-UC-3 or ASS1 silencing in RT112 cells reversed these effects. ADI-PEG 20 treatment of mice bearing contralateral flank UM-UC-3 and RT112 xenografts selectively arrested tumor growth in UM-UC-3 xenografts, which had reduced tumor size, reduced Ki-67, and increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining. This suggests that ASS1 loss occurs in invasive bladder cancer and is targetable by ADI-PEG 20.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Objective: To investigate the expressions of endoglin (CD105), erythropoietin-producing hepatocyte receptor A2 (EphA2) and its ligand ephrinA1 proteins in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and the relationship between their expressions and the clinicopathological factors of LSCC. Methods: The expressions of CD105, EphA2 and EphrinA1 proteins were detected with immunohistochemical staining in LSCC in 76 cases and adjacent normal laryngeal tissues (ANLT) (S-P) in 25 cases.SPSS 17.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results: The mean microvessel density (MVD) value marked by CD105 staining in LSCC was 10.33  2.29, which was significantly higher than that in ANLT(1.20  1.04, t=18.732, P&lt;0.05). The CD105-MVD was correlated with T stage, histological grading, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, recurrence and prognosis in LSCC (F value was 5.34, 4.79, 5.36, t value was -2.70, 2.56, all P&lt;0.05). The positive expression rates of EphA2 and EphrinA1 in LSCC were 78.95% (60/76), and 81.85% (62/76), which were respectively significantly higher than 40% (10/25) for EphA2 expression and 44% (11/25) for EphrinA1, expression in ANLT (  (2) value was 13.41, 13.26, both P&lt;0.05). EphA2 expression was correlated with histological grading, T stage, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, recurrence and prognosis in LSCC (  (2) value was 6.25, 14.60, 15.11, 8.52, 5.54, all P&lt;0.05). EphrinA1 expression was correlated with T stage, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, recurrence and prognosis in LSCC (  (2) value was 6.44, 12.28, 16.78, 6.44, all P&lt;0.05). The expressions of CD105, EphA2 and EphrinA1 were positively correlated with each other r value was 0.72, 0.74, 0.64, all P&lt;0.05. Survival analysis indicated that the expressions of CD105 and EphA2, histological grading, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage and recurrence were independent factors for tumor prognosis in LSCC (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The expressions of CD105, EphA2 and EphrinA1 protein were positively correlated with each other in LSCC. They may play important roles in the tumorigenesis, malignant progression and poor prognosis of LSCC.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: It is very difficult to deal with the comprehensive central airway diseases, especially the malignant airway obstruction. The aim of this study is to explore the clinical effects of multiple interventional bronchoscopies for the treatment of 112 cases with comprehensive malignant central airway diseases so as to evaluate the clinical applications of thermoablation and cryosurgery. METHODS: The 112 cases with malignant airway diseases retrospectively reviewed for bronchoscopic interventions performed in more than two lesions of carina and/or bifurcation. The age was from 22 to 90 years, which including 55 cases with squamous carcinoma (SQ), 16 adenocarcinoma (AD), 15 adenocystic carcinoma (ACC), 10 metastasis tumor (MT), 8 small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and 8 mixed carcinoma (MC). All bronchoscopic interventions such as argon plasma coagulation (APC), cryosurgery, electronic snare and stenting were performed under rigid bronchoscopy combined with electric bronchoscopy in general anesthesia. RESULTS: The 460 bronchoscopic procedures were successfully performed in 112 cases. Cryosurgery and APC were the most used in every group. Stent was more common in patients with MT, balloon dilation was more common in patients with ACC and AD. Electric snare and radioactive seeds implantation were frequently used in cases with SCLC. Trachea stricture is more severe in MT than that in others, while bronchus stricture is more severe than that of trachea in SQ and ACC group. Karnofsky performance score (KPS) is lower and shortness of breath score (SBS) is higher in MC, MT and SCLC group. Trachea and bronchus stricture is improved after comprehensive treatment in 5 groups except of mixed group. KPS increased and SS decreased significantly in 5 groups except of adenocarcinoma. In follow-up, the overall survival time (OS) is 15 months and median survival time is 10 months, especially OS is 28.4 months in ACC and 21.7 months in AD, 8.9 months in SCLC and 7.4 months in mixed group. CONCLUSIONS: APC combination with Cryosurgery and other bronchoscopic interventions are indicated for the treatment of complex or difficult airway diseases whether they are located in trachea or bronchus. It is a safe and rapid during procedure.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) has been identified as an inhibitor of JAK/STAT pathway that plays a significant role in carcinogenesis. SOCS3 and JAK2 polymorphisms may influence the gene expression or function, contributing to the disease susceptibility; however, such effect has not been evaluated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: A case-control study was performed to test the associations of SOCS3 and JAK2 polymorphisms with risk of HNSCC in 576 cases and 1552 cancer-free controls from China. Seven potentially functional polymorphisms predicted by bioinformatics tools were genotyped using Infinium BeadChip platform. The association between genotypes and HNSCC risk was estimated by computing odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: We found that rs2280148 located at 3'-untranslated region of SOCS3 was significantly associated with an increased risk of HNSCC (additive model: adjusted OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.03-1.43, P=0.021). Moreover, rs8064821 located in the promoter region of SOCS3 was linked with a decreased risk of the cancer (additive model: adjusted OR=0.83, 95% CI= 0.71-0.97, P=0.022). Combined analysis of these variants by the number of risk alleles showed a significant locus-dosage effect on the risk of HNSCC (Ptrend = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: We provided the first evidence that SOCS3 polymorphisms may influence the risk of HNSCC, which could be applied as novel biomarkers to identify individuals at high risk of the disease.

<text>Macrolide Antibiotics Exhibit Cytotoxic Effect under Amino Acid-Depleted Culture Condition by Blocking Autophagy Flux in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>170</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Autophagy, a self-digestive system for cytoplasmic components, is required to maintain the amino acid pool for cellular homeostasis. We previously reported that the macrolide antibiotics azithromycin (AZM) and clarithromycin (CAM) have an inhibitory effect on autophagy flux, and they potently enhance the cytocidal effect of various anticancer reagents in vitro. This suggests that macrolide antibiotics can be used as an adjuvant for cancer chemotherapy. Since cancer cells require a larger metabolic demand than normal cells because of their exuberant growth, upregulated autophagy in tumor cells has now become the target for cancer therapy. In the present study, we examined whether macrolides exhibit cytotoxic effect under an amino acid-starving condition in head and neck squamous cancer cell lines such as CAL 27 and Detroit 562 as models of solid tumors with an upregulated autophagy in the central region owing to hypovascularity. AZM and CAM induced cell death under the amino acid-depleted (AAD) culture condition in these cell lines along with CHOP upregulation, although they showed no cytotoxicity under the complete culture medium. CHOP knockdown by siRNA in the CAL 27 cells significantly suppressed macrolide-induced cell death under the AAD culture condition. CHOP-/- murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines also attenuated AZM-induced cell death compared with CHOP+/+ MEF cell lines. Using a tet-off atg5 MEF cell line, knockout of atg5, an essential gene for autophagy, also induced cell death and CHOP in the AAD culture medium but not in the complete culture medium. This suggest that macrolide-induced cell death via CHOP induction is dependent on autophagy inhibition. The cytotoxicity of macrolide with CHOP induction was completely cancelled by the addition of amino acids in the culture medium, indicating that the cytotoxicity is due to the insufficient amino acid pool. These data suggest the possibility of using macrolides for "tumor-starving therapy".</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: A retrospective analysis was conducted to investigate outcomes of elderly patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who underwent surgery or chemoradiotherapy (CRT).We performed a retrospective review of the records of elderly patients (&gt;= 70 years) with resectable ESCC who underwent esophagectomy or CRT between January 2009 and March 2013. According to the main treatment strategy, patients were allocated into either surgery group or CRT group. Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival and progression-free survival were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model, respectively.A total of 188 patients were enrolled. Eighty-eight patients underwent esophagectomy, and 100 patients underwent CRT. The median age of the patients was 73 years (range, 70-81 years) in the surgery group and 76 years (range, 70-88 years) in the CRT group. The median survival time (MST) for the whole cohort was 25.6 months, and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 69.2%, 36.1%, and 21.9%, respectively. The MST in the surgery group and the CRT group was 36 months and 15 months, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in the surgery group were 82.4%, 49.0%, and 33.3%, compared to 58.0%, 24.1%, and 7.8% in the CRT group (P&lt;0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that lymph node status (hazard ratio [HR]=0.598, P=0.011) and treatment strategies (HR=0.538, P=0.001) were independent and significant prognostic factors for OS in elderly patients.Surgery was the main treatment strategy for elderly patients with ESCC. Advanced age and comorbidities should not be the cause for elderly patients to avoid aggressive regimens. Delivered therapeutic approaches should be individualized on the basis of carefully evaluating the balance of benefits, risks, and life expectancy.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: In patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the status of metastasis to lymph nodes is strongly associated with prognosis. Consequently, development of a biomarker to detect the presence of metastasis would be clinically valuable. In this study, we found that overexpression of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) was applicable as a marker for prediction of metastasis in ESCC. CB1R overexpression was detected immunohistochemically in 54 of 88 cases (61.4%). The intensity of CB1R expression was uniform in both intraepithelial and invasive regions in each case, and was significantly correlated with the status of metastasis to lymph nodes (P   =   0.046) and distant organs (P   =   0.047). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that CB1R overexpression was independently associated with poor prognosis (P   =   0.019). Biological analysis of CB1R overexpression using ESCC cell lines revealed that CB1R activation appeared to promote cell proliferation and invasion. On the basis of these findings, we propose that evaluation of CB1R expression status in biopsy specimens of ESCC using immunohistochemistry might be clinically useful for prediction of metastasis to lymph nodes and distant organs.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the expression of p-AKT, p-JNK, FoxO3a and KI-67 in samples of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) and Oral Epithelial Dysplasias (OEDs) to understand their possible involvement in the malignant transformation process of oral lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue samples of 20 cases of OSCCs, 20 OEDs and normal oral mucosa were subjected to immunohistochemistry reactions for anti-p-Akt, anti-p-JNK, anti-FoxO3a and anti-Ki-67 antibodies. It was analyzed quantitative (number of immunostained cells) and qualitative (immunostaining intensity) parameters in different cell immunostaining sublocations. RESULTS: Nuclear p-AKT was observed significantly greater immunostaining in OSCC (21.2    19.0) than in dysplasias (7.9    8.1) and control (1.8    4.7) (p = 0.002). Immunostaining of strong nuclear p-JNK was greater in controls (48.3    13.7) than in OEDs (11.0    10.3) and OSCCs (1.1    1.3) (p&lt;0.001). Strong nuclear immunostaining of FoxO3a proved to be absent in OSCCs (0.0    0.1) with little staining on dysplasias (3.2    5.4) and increased expression in controls (13.5    4.8) (p&lt;0.001). Immunostaining of strong nuclear ki-67 was grater in OSCCs (48.1  49.6) than in OED (11.8  10.6) and controls (1.9  2.0) (p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Malignant process of OEDs in this research may involve the same mechanisms of established malignant lesions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</text>

<text>Proteomic signatures reveal a dualistic and clinically relevant classification of anal canal carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>103</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Etiologically linked to HPV infection, malignancies of the anal canal have substantially increased in incidence over the last 20 years. Although most anal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) respond well to chemoradiotherapy, about 30% of patients experience a poor outcome, for undetermined reasons. Despite cumulative efforts for discovering independent predictors of overall survival, both nodal status and tumour size are still the only reliable factors predicting patient outcome. Recent efforts have revealed that the biology of HPV-related lesions in the cervix is strongly linked to the originally infected cell population. To address the hypothesis that topography also influences both gene expression profile and behaviour of anal (pre)neoplastic lesions, we correlated both proteomic signatures and clinicopathological features of tumours arising from two distinct portions of the anal canal: the lower part (squamous zone) and the more proximal anal transitional zone. Although microdissected cancer cells appeared indistinguishable by morphology (squamous phenotype), unsupervised clustering analysis of the whole proteome significantly highlighted the heterogeneity that exists within anal canal tumours. More importantly, two region-specific subtypes of SCC were revealed. The expression profile (sensitivity/specificity) of several selected biomarkers (keratin filaments) further confirmed the subclassification of anal (pre)cancers based on their cellular origin. Less commonly detected compared to their counterparts located in the squamous mucosa, SCC originating in the transitional zone more frequently displayed a poor or basaloid differentiation, and were significantly correlated with reduced disease-free and overall survivals. Taken together, we present direct evidence that anal canal SCC comprises two distinct entities with different cells of origin, proteomic signatures and survival rates. This study forms the basis for a dualistic classification of anal carcinoma, with implications for management, outcome expectations and possibly therapy.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Isobutyl-deoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) is a selective substrate for NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), an enzyme overexpressed in many solid tumors. Following activation by NQO1, IB-DNQ participates in a catalytic futile reduction/reoxidation cycle with consequent toxic reactive oxygen species generation within the tumor microenvironment. To elucidate the potential of IB-DNQ to serve as a novel anticancer agent, in vitro studies coupled with in vivo pharmacokinetic and toxicologic investigations in the domestic felid species were conducted to investigate the tractability of IB-DNQ as a translationally applicable anticancer agent. First, using feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as a comparative cancer model, expressions of NQO1 were characterized in not only human, but also feline OSCC tissue microarrays. Second, IB-DNQ mediated cytotoxicity in three immortalized feline OSCC cell lines were studied under dose-dependent and sequential exposure conditions. Third, the feasibility of administering IB-DNQ at doses predicted to achieve cytotoxic plasma concentrations and biologically relevant durations of exposure were investigated through pharmacokinetic and tolerability studies in healthy research felines. Intravenous administration of IB-DNQ at 1.0-2.0  mg/kg achieved peak plasma concentrations and durations of exposure reaching or exceeding predicted in vitro cytotoxic concentrations. Clinical adverse side effects including ptyalism and tachypnea exhibited during and post-IV infusion of IB-DNQ were transient and tolerable. Additionally, IB-DNQ administration did not produce acute or delayed-onset unacceptable hematologic, non-hematologic, or off-target oxidative toxicities. Collectively, the findings reported here within provide important safety and pharmacokinetic data to support the continued development of IB-DNQ as a novel anticancer strategy for NQO1 expressing cancers.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the survival rate of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and expression of two biomarkers along with age, gender, tumor margin, depth of invasion, site of tumor, tumor diameter, tumor grade, number of involved nodes, and vascular invasion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective survey, medical records of patients referred to the Shohada-e Tajrish hospital during 2001 to 2005 were reviewed and subjects with definite diagnosis of SCC were included. Required data were extracted from the patients' records, and their prepared paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were collected under supervision of two pathologists. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was performed at the Firoozgar hospital in Tehran, Iran. RESULTS: The studied population included 20 men (74%) and 7 women (26%). The mean age at diagnosis was 58      22. Results showed significantly higher survival rates in women compared to men (85.7 vs. 40%) (p  =  0.001) and in patients with well-differentiated tumors compared to poor-differentiated cases (20 vs. 5%) (p  =  0.004). No significant relationship was found between p53 expression and prognostic factors like age, gender, the site, grade, and size of the tumor, depth of invasion, involvement of lymph nodes, and vascular invasion. CONCLUSION: Positivity of p53 and cyclin D1 was not found to be predictive of survival in patients with esophageal SCC which might be due to the small sample size of the present survey. Further investigations with larger sample populations and longer follow-ups are required to evaluate this correlation.</text>

<text>Liquid Biopsy: A Future Tool for Posttreatment Surveillance in Head and Neck Cancer?</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>84</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: The prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is largely based on disease stage. Despite improvements in treatment, recurrence rates are still considered high. Currently, disease progression or regression after curative treatment is monitored by clinical evaluation combined with flexible endoscopy and/or imaging. However, specificity of imaging is low due to the posttreatment effects. Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from blood samples of HNSCC patients is a minimally invasive technique that could lead to an earlier detection of recurrence. In addition, digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) could be used to sensitively detect these mutational targets. Future study on ctDNA using ddPCR in blood samples of HNSCC patients is recommended during the follow-up stage to detect recurrences in a timely manner.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Cancer stem-like cells have been identified in primary human tumors and cancer cell lines. Previously we found TM4SF1 gene was highly expressed in side population (SP) cells from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines, but the role and underlying mechanism of TM4SF1 in ESCC remain unclear. In this study, we observed TM4SF1 was up-regulated but miR-141 was down-regulated in SP cells isolated from ESCC cell lines. TM4SF1 could stimulate the self-renewal ability and carcinogenicity of esophageal cancer stem-like cells, and promote cell invasion and migration. In miR-141 overexpression cells, the expression of TM4SF1 was significantly reduced. We also found that overexpression of miR-141 could abolish the self-renewal ability and carcinogenicity of esophageal cancer stem-like cells and decrease cell invasion and migration by suppressing TM4SF1. Consequently, TM4SF1 is a direct target gene of miR-141. The regulation of TM4SF1 by miR-141 may play an important role in controlling self-renewals of esophageal cancer stem-like cells. It may also promote the development of new therapeutic strategies and efficient drugs to target ESCC stem-like cells.</text>

<text>Genome wide copy number analyses of superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with and without metastasis.</text>
</passage>

<offset>111</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is generally considered a subtype of less invasive ESCC. Yet a subset of these superficial ESCC would have metastasis after esophagostomy or endoscopic resection and lead to poor prognosis. The objective of this study is to determine biomarkers that can identify such subset of superficial ESCC that would have metastasis after surgery using genome wide copy number alteration (CNA) analyses. The CNAs of 38 cases of superficial ESCCs originated from radical surgery, including 19 without metastasis and 19 with metastasis within 5 years' post-surgery, were analyzed using Affymetrix OncoScan    FFPE Assay. A 39-gene signature was identified which characterized the subset of superficial ESCC with high risk of metastasis after surgery. In addition, recurrent CNAs of superficial ESCC were also investigated in the study. Amplification of 11q13.3 (FGF4) and deletion of 9p21.3 (CDKN2A) were found to be recurrent in all 38 superficial ESCCs analyzed. Notably amplifications of 3p26.33 (SOX2OT), 8q24.21 (MYC), 14q21.1 (FOXA1) and deletion of 3p12.1 (GBE1) were only found to be recurrent in metastaic superficial ESCCs. In conclusion, using CNAs analyses, we identify a 39-gene signature which characterizes the high risk metastatic superficial ESCCs and discover several recurrent CNAs that might be the driver alterations in metastasis among superficial ESCCs.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Radiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients is limited by resistance to ionizing radiation (IR). However, the roles and mechanisms of microRNAs in radioresistance are obscure. Here, we investigated that microRNA-205 (miR-205) was upregulated in radioresistant (RR) ESCC cells compared with the parental cells. Overexpression of miR-205 promoted colony survival post-IR, whereas depletion of miR-205 sensitized ESCC cells to IR in vitro and in vivo. Further, we demonstrated that miR-205 promoted radioresistance by enhancing DNA repair, inhibiting apoptosis and activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, miR-205, upregulated post-IR, was demonstrated to be activated by Sp1 in parallel with its host gene, miR-205HG, both of which showed a perfect correlation. We also identified and validated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), as a target of miR-205 that promoted radioresistance via PI3K/AKT pathway. Lastly, increased miR-205 expression was closely associated with decreased PTEN expression in ESCC tissues and miR-205 expression predicted poor prognosis in patients with ESCC. Taken together, these findings identify miR-205 as a critical determinant of radioresistance and a biomarker of prognosis. The Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation of miR-205 promotes radioresistance through PTEN via PI3K/AKT pathway in ESCC. Inhibition of miR-205 expression may be a new strategy for radiotherapy in ESCC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Even though infection with human papillomaviruses (HPV) is very important, it is not the sole cause of cervical cancer. Because it is known that genetic variations that result from HPV infection are probably the most important causes of cervical cancer, we used human whole genome array comparative genomic hybridization to detect the copy number variations of genes in cervical squamous cell carcinoma. The results of the array were validated by PCR, FISH and immunohistochemistry. We find that the copy number and protein expression of claudin-1 (CLDN1) increase with the progression of cervical cancer. The strong positive staining of CLDN1 in the cervical lymph node metastasis group received a significantly higher score than the staining in the group with no lymph node metastasis of cervical cancer tissues. The overexpression of CLDN1 in SiHa cells can increase anti-apoptosis ability and promote invasive ability of these cells accompanied by a decrease in expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin as well as an increase in the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin. CLDN1 induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through its interaction with SNAI1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CLDN1 overexpression has significant effects on the growth and metastasis of xenografted tumors in athymic mice. These data suggest that CLDN1 promotes invasion and metastasis in cervical cancer cells via the expression of EMT/invasion-related genes. Therefore, CLDN1 could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cervical cancer.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of miR-101-3p on the viability, migration, invasion and mitosis of lung squamous carcinoma cells by inhibiting EZH2. In this study, RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of miR-101-3p and EZH2 in both tissues and cells at RNA level. The dual luciferase reporter gene system was used to determine whether there was targeting relationship between miR-101-3p and EZH2-3'UTR. Western Blot was used to detect the expression of EZH2 as well as the proliferation and invasion related proteins. The CCK-8 assay, Transwell invasion assay, wound healing assay and flow cytometry were conducted to test the cell viability, invasion, migration and apoptosis. The results of RT-qPCR and Western blot showed that miR-101-3p was low-expressed and EZH2 was overexpressed in lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues and cells. Meanwhile the Western blot confirmed the effects of EZH2 expression on the proliferation and invasion of carcinoma cells. The results of luciferase assay and RT-qPCR showed that miR-101-3p had a negative regulation effect on EZH2. The CCK-8 assay, Transwell invasion assay, wound healing assay and flow cytometry results showed that the inhibition of EZH2 or the up-regulation of miR-101-3p inhibited the viability, migration, invasion and cell cycle but promoted cell apoptosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma. MiR-101-3p could inhibit the viability, migration, invasion and cell cycle of lung squamous carcinoma cells by inhibiting the EZH2.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common public health problem worldwide with poor prognosis, which is largely due to lymph node metastasis and recurrence. Identification of specific molecular markers of OSCC with lymph node metastasis would be very important for early and specific diagnosis. In this study, we screened for the potential prognosis markers via unbiased transcriptomic microarray analysis in paired two OSCC cell lines, a lymph node metastatic HN12 cell line and a low metastatic parental HN4 cell line. The results showed that vimentin, with 87-fold increase of expression, was on the top of all upregulated genes in metastatic HN12 cells compared to non-metastatic HN4 cells. Treatment of non-metastatic HN4 cells with TGF-b1 induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), with increased vimentin expression as well as enhanced migration activity. Consistently, knockdown of vimentin via siRNA resulted in suppressed invasion and migration activities of HN12 cells, suggesting an essential role of vimentin in EMT-related functions of OSCC cells. Finally, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining analysis showed that high vimentin expression was strongly associated with high lymph node metastases (p   &lt;   0.05), and poor overall survival (p   &lt;   0.05) in OSCC patients. Thus, high vimentin expression is strongly associated with increased metastatic potential, and may serve as a prediction marker for poor prognosis in OSCC patients.</text>

<text>Quantitative analysis of tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia in different histological grades of oral squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>127</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the 8 th most common aggressive epithelial malignant neoplasm worldwide today. The eosinophil may be a "multifaceted cell" that can be associated with wound-healing processes, as well as to tissue damage which has increased the speculations around tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia in malignant tumors. The aim of this study was to detect the role and quantitative analysis of tumor-associated tissue eosinophils in different histological grades of OSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in sixty cases of histopathologically graded OSCCs. Tissue sections of 4   thickness were made from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Eosinophils were counted under randomly selected twenty high-power (*40) fields. Data were subjected to statistical analysis using ANOVA test. RESULTS: Higher mean eosinophils were recorded in well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (WDSCC) followed by moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (MDSCC) and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (PDSCC) groups, respectively. The difference in mean eosinophils was found to be statistically significant between WDSCC and MDSCC (P &lt; 0.001), as well as between WDSCC and PDSCC (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Tumor-associated tissue eosinophil count is higher in WDSCC as compared to moderate and PDSCC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Peroxiredoxin (PRDX) proteins are involved in carcinogenesis. PRDX3, which is predominantly localized in mitochondria and up-regulated in several human cancers, seems to confer increased treatment resistance and aggressive phenotypes. This study examined the expression profile of PRDX3 and its possible clinical value in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). The expression of PRDX3 in LSCC samples was confirmed by Western blotting and further analyzed by immunohistochemistry in LSCC samples of different clinical pathological stages. The results showed that up-regulated expression of PRDX3 was observed in LSCC and associated with poor differentiation (P &lt; 0.01), primary tumor location, N category and tumor stage (P &lt; 0.05). Knockdown of PRDX3 in the Hep-2 laryngeal carcinoma epithelial cell line significantly enhanced Hep-2 cells' apoptosis and inhibited their proliferation and migration. Taken together, our results suggest that PRDX3 has substantial clinical impact on the progression of LSCC and shed new light on the role of PRDX3 in treatment resistance and aggressive phenotypes in LSCC.</text>

<text>Construction of differential mRNA-lncRNA crosstalk networks based on ceRNA hypothesis uncover key roles of lncRNAs implicated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Increasing evidence has indicated that lncRNAs acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) play crucial roles in tumorigenesis, metastasis and diagnosis of cancer. However, the function of lncRNAs as ceRNAs involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still largely unknown. In this study, clinical implications of two intrinsic subtypes of ESCC were identified based on expression profiles of lncRNA and mRNA. ESCC subtype-specific differential co-expression networks between mRNAs and lncRNAs were constructed to reveal dynamic changes of their crosstalks mediated by miRNAs during tumorigenesis. Several well-known cancer-associated lncRNAs as the hubs of the two networks were firstly proposed in ESCC. Based on the ceRNA mechanism, we illustrated that the"loss" of miR-186-mediated PVT1-mRNA and miR-26b-mediated LINC00240-mRNA crosstalks were related to the two ESCC subtypes respectively. In addition, crosstalks between LINC00152 and EGFR, LINC00240 and LOX gene family were identified, which were associated with the function of "response to wounding" and "extracellular matrix-receptor interaction". Furthermore, functional cooperation of multiple lncRNAs was discovered in the two differential mRNA-lncRNA crosstalk networks. These together systematically uncovered the roles of lncRNAs as ceRNAs implicated in ESCC.</text>

<offset>82</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND/AIM: This study assessed the trend changes in the histological types of esophageal cancer in a 25-year period in eastern Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched all cases of esophageal cancer from 1990 to 2015 according to their histological diagnosis and sex, grouping the patients in 5-year time periods to evaluate time trends. RESULTS: We identified 1462 cases of esophageal cancer. In terms of patient make-up, 742 were male and 720 were female. In general, 75.86% of the patients had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 19.56% of the patients had adenocarcinoma (ADC), and the remaining 4.58% patients were found to have other histopathologic disorders. While the SCC to ADC ratio was 1.76 between 1990 and 1994, this rate increased to 8.73 between 2010 and 2014; during these periods, the male to female ratio decreased from 1.43 to 0.86. Between these two periods, statistically significant changes were observed of SCC and the number of female patients (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.008, respectively). CONCLUSION: While the incidence of esophagus ADC and the number of male patients increased recently in Western countries, the number of female patients and SCC cases increased in our region in the last 25 years.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVE: Opportunistic infections may affect the oral mucosa of patients undergoing radio/chemotherapy through exacerbation of oral mucositis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the oral shedding of all eight human herpesviruses and its possible association with oral mucositis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we analyzed oral rinse samples, collected weekly, from 20 patients during radiotherapy treatment. Serologic status to HSV1 and HSV2, EBV, CMV, and VZV in three different periods was performed by ELISA assay. PCR and enzymatic digestion was performed to detect HSV1, HSV2, EBV, CMV, VZV, HHV6, HHV7, and HHV8. Oral mucositis was evaluated according to the WHO criteria. RESULTS: Oral shedding of EBV, HHV6, and HHV7 was observed in all weeks of radiotherapy. Considering the episodes of shedding, the highest frequency was found in patients with EBV excretion (55.0%). No virus reactivation was observed by serological analysis. EBV oral shedding frequency was significantly higher than that of other viruses and showing a positive correlation with oral mucositis grade &gt;= 2. CONCLUSIONS: There was a positive correlation between EBV oral shedding and oral mucositis grade &gt;= 2, particularly after 3  weeks of radiotherapy, a period in which the severity of mucositis was statistically higher. These findings allow us to infer that the local inflammatory environment in mucositis grade &gt;= 2 is more favorable for EBV replication. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mucositis is a frequent and important side effect of radio/chemotherapy treatment. Understanding the possible participation of viruses in the mechanism of this condition is important to develop strategies for treatment and prevention.</text>

<text>PURPOSE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Although improvements in surgical techniques, chemotherapy and radiation delivery, and supportive care have improved quality of life for patients with HNSCC, regional and distant recurrence remain common. Recent evidence suggests that cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) play a significant role in recurrence and chemo-resistant. We previously observed that c-Fos was highly up-regulated in the HNSCC sphere forming cells. Consequences of c-Fos upregulation for the biology of HNSCC-CSCs are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of c-Fos in renewal of stemness of HNSCC and tumor growth. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: We generated stable HNSCC cell lines ectopically expressing the c-Fos gene. Exogenous expression of c-Fos in non-tumorigenic MDA1386Tu cells makes these cells tumorigenic in nude mice. Further, subcutaneous transplantation of c-Fos overexpressing Cal27 cells (tumorigenic) into immunocompromised mice enhanced tumor growth as compared to parental cells. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that c-Fos overexpression enhanced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) state and expression of CSC markers (Nanog, c-Myc, Sox2 and Notch1). Ectopic expression of c-Fos in HNSCC cells also display increased number of sphere formation. We further observed that overexpression of c-Fos increased the expression of pERK and cyclin D1 in HNSCC cells. CONCLUSION: Together, our results strongly suggest a novel role of c-Fos as a regulator of EMT and cancer stem cell reprogramming in HNSCC cells, which may hold potential as a CSC-directed therapeutic approach to improve HNSCC treatment.</text>

<offset>55</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: 4-Thiazolidinones are a known class of prospective drug-like molecules, especially in the design of new anticancer agents. Two of the most prominent subtypes of these compounds are 5-ene-2-amino(amino)-4-thiazolidinones and thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles. The latter are considered to be cyclic mimetics of biologically active 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones with similar pharmacological profiles. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 4-thiazolidinone-based compounds on cytotoxicity, the apoptotic process, and metabolism in the human squamous carcinoma (SCC-15) cell line. The SCC-15  cells were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, hydrocortisone, and exposed to rising concentrations (1  nM-100   M) of the studied compounds for 6, 24 and 48  h. Afterwards, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, cell viability, caspase-3 activity, and cell metabolism were measured. The obtained results showed that all of the studied compounds in a wide range of concentrations (1  nM-100   M) increased DCF fluorescence which suggests a stimulation of ROS production. Nevertheless, these new compounds showed cytotoxic and proapoptotic properties only at high (10-100   M) concentrations. Our studies are the first to be carried out on these compounds and require further investigation to clarify the mechanism of action of their anticancer potential.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) is a significant mediator of diverse responses to DNA damage. The present study was aimed to identify possible interactive proteins of Chk2 and try to clarify the underlying mechanism regarding Chk2 chromatin loading and its phosphorylation to DNA damage response in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Differently tagged Chk2 and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex (MCM2, MCM3, MCM5, and MCM6) were overexpressed into SCC-4 cells. After 48 h of transfection cell fractionation was performed to localize proteins. In addition, immunoreactive species were detected by immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblot (IB) analysis, and protein-protein interaction between Chk2 and MCM complex was ensured by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. Expression of MCM2 and MCM6 was down-regulated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), and the chromatin and non-chromatin fraction were analyzed. The expression of Chk2 phosphorylation (pT68-Chk2) was measured after administration of different dosages of siMCM2 (0.5  g, 1  g, and 2.5  g) and camptothecin (CPT). Our results showed that Chk2 directly interacts with MCM2, MCM3, MCM5, and MCM6 in SCC-4 cells. Downregulation of MCM2 and MCM6 markedly reduced Chk2 chromatin fraction, and downregulation of MCM2 decreased the expression of pT68-Chk2 to DNA damage response in a dose manner. Our results suggest that the interaction between Chk2 and MCM complex is required for Chk2 chromatin loading and its phosphorylation to DNA damage response in SCC-4 cells.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Homeobox A5 (HOXA5) is a member of the homeobox (HOX) family and was upregulated in many types of tumors. However, its expression and role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unclear. In this study, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression and function of HOXA5 in ESCC. Our results showed that HOXA5 was highly expressed in ESCC cell lines. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that knockdown of HOXA5 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells. Furthermore, the in vivo experiments showed that knockdown of HOXA5 significantly inhibited the tumor growth of ESCC in mice xenograft model. Finally, sh-HOXA5 inhibited the expression of b-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc in ESCC cells. Taken together, these data revealed that knockdown of HOXA5 suppressed the proliferation and metastasis partly by interfering with Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway in ESCC cells. Therefore, these findings suggest that HOXA5 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ESCC.</text>

<text>Genetic variants at 9p21.3 are associated with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in a Chinese population.</text>
</passage>

<offset>114</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked genetic variants at 9p21.3 to the risk of multiple cancers. However, the roles of genetic variants at 9p21.3 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) development are largely unknown. Here we evaluated the genetic variants at 9p21.3 reported in cancer GWAS with case-control study including 2,139 ESCC cases and 2,273 controls in a Chinese population, and measured the mRNA expression levels of MTAP, CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDKN2B-AS1 in paired ESCC tumor and adjacent normal tissues. We found that the G allele of rs7023329 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of ESCC with a per-allele odds ratio (OR) of 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77-0.91; P=2.95*10(-5) ). The rs7023329-G allele was related to a high expression of MTAP (P=0.020). The rs1679013-C allele was independently associated with an increased risk of ESCC with a per-allele OR of 1.12 (95% CI, 1.01-1.24; P=0.039). We also found that the carriers of the risk allele rs1679013-C had lower expressions of CDKN2B than non-carriers (P=0.035). CDKN2B was also significantly down-regulated in ESCC tumor tissues as compared with adjacent normal tissues (P=3.50*10(-5) ). Therefore, our findings indicate that genetic variants at 9p21.3 may modulate the expression of MTAP and CDKN2B and contribute to ESCC susceptibility. This may further advance our understanding of 9p21.3 locus in cancer development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVES: To assess the prognostic performance of a new N classification that incorporates the log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS) into the routinely used pathological N classification for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study utilising LODDS into pN category was performed, and the AJCC TNM stage and T-New N-M stage were compared with respect to 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rates. The discriminability was evaluated from the linear trend chi-square test, Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Harrell's c-statistic. SETTING: Medical centrer in Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 463 patients received primary surgery and neck dissection between 2004 and 2013 for OSCC. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The discriminability for 5-year DSS rates. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 54  months, the mean patient age was 54      11  years and 428 patients (92.4%) were male. The patients with higher LODDS had worse 5-year DSS rates. Incorporation of LODDS into the prognostic model based on the seventh edition of the TNM classification significantly improved discriminative performance for 5-year DSS with a lower AIC (1883 versus 1897), and higher prediction accuracy (Harrell's c-statistic: 0.768 versus 0.764). CONCLUSIONS: By utilising a merger of the LODDS and pN classifications to create a new N classification has better discriminatory and predictive ability than pathological TNM staging and could help identify high-risk patients for intense adjuvant therapy.</text>

<text>The Preoperative Neutrophil-To-Lymphocyte Ratio Is a Novel Immune Parameter for the Prognosis of Esophageal Basaloid Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>141</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an independent predictor of prognosis in various malignancies, but its predictive capacity in basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (BSCCE) remains unclear. We aim to determine the value of the inflammation-related factors, including the NLR, neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio (NMR), and albumin levels, in predicting BSCCE prognosis. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 121 patients with pathologically diagnosed BSCCE that underwent a curative esophagectomy from January 2007 to December 2014. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: The preoperative NLR was correlated with the tumor length and NMR. In OS univariate analyses, a high NLR (&gt;1.77), high NMR (&gt;12.31), and low albumin (&lt;= 40.0 g/L) level were significantly associated with a poorer survival in BSCCE. The median OS was significantly greater in low NLR (&lt;= 1.77) than in the high NLR (&gt;1.77) patients (51.0 vs. 31.0 months; P = 0.008). In multivariate analyses, only the NLR was an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio (HR), 2.030; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.262-3.264; P = 0.003). A high NLR was also an independent predictor of a poorer RFS in BSCCE (HR, 2.222; 95% CI, 1.407-3.508; P = 0.001); the median RFS for low (&lt;= 1.77) and high (&gt; 1.77) NLR patients was 44.0 months and 14.0 months, respectively. NLR remained a strong prognostic indicator for OS in stage I/II patients and a preoperative NLR&gt;1.77 was predictive of a poor RFS in both stage I/II and stage III patients. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the preoperative NLR, a convenient and cost-effective biomarker, may serve as a prognostic indicator for BSCCE patients following curative surgery.</text>

<text>Integration of Pathway Knowledge and Dynamic Bayesian Networks for the Prediction of Oral Cancer Recurrence.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>108</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) has been characterized as a complex disease which involves dynamic genomic changes at the molecular level. These changes indicate the worth to explore the interactions of the molecules and especially of differentially expressed genes that contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, based on this knowledge the identification of differentially expressed genes and related molecular pathways is of great importance. In the present study we exploit differentially expressed genes in order to further perform pathway enrichment analysis. According to our results we found significant pathways in which the disease associated genes have been identified as strongly enriched. Furthermore, based on the results of the pathway enrichment analysis we propose a methodology for predicting oral cancer recurrence using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. The methodology takes into consideration time series gene expression data in order to predict a disease recurrence. Subsequently, we are able to conjecture about the causal interactions between genes in consecutive time intervals. Concerning the performance of the predictive models, the overall accuracy of the algorithm is 81.8% and the area under the ROC curve 89.2% regarding the knowledge from the overrepresented Pre-NOTCH Expression and Processing pathway.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Laryngeal carcinoma  (LC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of all head and neck squamous cell carcinomas  (HNSCCs). However, the molecular mechanism and genetic basis of the development of LC have not been fully elucidated. To explore the possible mechanism, targeted proteomic analysis was performed on Bcl-2-associated proteins from LC cells. According to our results, 35 proteins associated with Bcl-2 were identified and Hsp90b was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. Protein  -protein interaction  (PPI) analysis indicated that Bcl-2  -Hsp90b interactions may be involved in the anti-apoptotic progression of LC. Further results revealed that disruption of the Bcl-2-Hsp90b interaction inhibited the anti-apoptotic ability of Bcl-2 and decreased the caspase activation in LC, which has broad implications for the better understanding of tumor formation, tumor cell survival and development of metastasis due to Bcl-2. Collectively, we report the mechanism by which Bcl-2 functions in LC as an anti-apoptotic factor in relation to its association with proteins and potentially identify a Bcl-2/Hsp90b axis as a novel target for LC therapy.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common malignant neoplasm of the head and neck. Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is one of its pre-cancerous lesions; however, the key molecular events in the tumorigenesis of OSF remain elusive. Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor  3  (DKK3) is one of the Wnt antagonists, and its downregulation and methylation have been reported in multiple malignancies, while no report of its expression in the carcinogenesis of OSF exists. In the present study, we investigated DKK3 expression at the protein and mRNA levels by immunochemical staining and semi  -quantitative RT-PCR in normal oral, OSF and OSCC tissues. We found that DKK3 was readily expressed in normal oral mucous tissues, but was gradually increased in early, moderately advanced and advanced OSF tissues, and strongly expressed in OSCC tissues. DKK3 was localized in the cytoplasm during OSF progression. A rare mutation of DKK3 was observed in OSCC, along with increased copy numbers. Furthermore, through analysis of its co-expressed genes, DDK3 may deregulate Wnt signaling, p53 signaling, apoptosis, Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial signaling pathways in OSCC pathogenesis. Thus, our results demonstrated that DKK3 is upregulated in the carcinogenesis of OSF, due to gain of copy number, which could be a potential tumor marker for the early detection of OSCC.</text>

<offset>112</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the oncological efficacy of salvage total laryngectomy in patients who had previously undergone supracricoid partial laryngectomy or transoral laser microsurgery for treatment of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. We retrospectively reviewed the medical, surgical and pathological records of 35 patients who underwent salvage total laryngectomy after recurrence of laryngeal cancer (following supracricoid partial laryngectomy or transoral laser microsurgery). Kaplan-Meier survival curves as well as univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors were performed. No statistically significant differences were seen comparing the supracricoid partial laryngectomy group with the transoral laser microsurgery group for overall survival and disease-specific survival at 3 years (OS = 38% vs. 52%, p = 0.16; DSS = 40% vs. 61%, p = 0.057) or locoregional control at 2 years (LRC = 40% vs. 54%, p = 0.056). A trend indicating worse survival and locoregional control for supracricoid partial laryngectomy patients emerged. Preservation of the osteocartilaginous frame in transoral laser microsurgery could hypothetically result in better salvageability of anterior recurrences with extralaryngeal spread.</text>

<text>A comparative study of cisplatin-based definitive chemo-radiation in non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>125</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: Esophageal cancer is the seventh most frequent malignancy in Iranian men and the fourth most common cancer in Iranian women. It is also among the 10 most frequent cancers in the world. Definitive chemo-radiation using cisplatin with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is known as the standard of care among various chemotherapy regimens used with esophageal cancer patients who are not eligible for surgery. Cisplatin with paclitaxel and cisplatin with irinotecan also have been used often during the past five years. The aim of this research was to compare overall survival (OS) and hematological toxicity rates between these regimens. METHODS: This single-institutional study included 55 patients who were treated with definitive chemo-radiation in the radiation-oncology ward at Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital in Tehran, Iran, between 2006 and 2013. They received one of four regimens, i.e., cisplatin, cisplatin with 5-FU (old chemotherapy regimens), cisplatin with paclitaxel, or cisplatin with irinotecan (new chemotherapy regimens) as part of their definitive chemo-radiation with curative intent. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to estimate the overall survival times, which were compared by using the Breslow test. RESULTS: The follow-up period was between 26-109 months, with a median of 72 months. OS was not different between the old and new chemotherapy regimen groups (p = 0.18). Hematological toxicity (leucopenia) in the old chemotherapy regimen groups (10%) was significantly lower than in the new chemotherapy regimen groups (43%, p = 0.012). But OS in cisplatin or cisplatin with 5-FU scheme was statistically better than with the cisplatin with paclitaxel scheme (p = 0.026, p = 0.028, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study showed that OS are similar in both the old and new chemotherapy treatment regimens in esophageal cancer patients who were treated with definitive chemo-radiation. The new chemotherapy treatment regimens should be used with caution as an alternative treatment of cisplatin with 5-FU for further evaluation.</text>

<text>Esophageal Cancer in Golestan Province, Iran: A Review of Genetic Susceptibility and Environmental Risk Factors.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>112</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive tumor that is typically diagnosed only when the tumor has gained remarkable size, extended to peripheral tissues, and led to dysphagia. Five-year survival of advanced cancer is still very poor (19%), even with improved surgical techniques and adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Therefore, early detection and prevention are the most important strategies to reduce the burden of ESCC. Our review will focus on the studies conducted in Golestan province, an area with a high prevalence of ESCC in northern Iran. We review three aspects of the research literature on ESCC: epidemiological features, environmental factors (including substance abuse, environmental contaminants, dietary factors, and human papillomavirus [HPV]), and molecular factors (including oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, cell cycle regulatory proteins, and other relevant biomarkers). Epidemiological and experimental data suggest that some chemicals and lifestyle factors, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), cigarette smoking, opium use, and hot tea drinking are associated with the development of ESCC in Golestan. HPV infects the esophageal epithelium, but so far, no firm evidence of its involvement in esophageal carcinogenesis has been provided. Some of these factors, notably hot tea drinking, may render the esophageal mucosa more susceptible to injury by other carcinogens. There are few studies at molecular level on ESCC in Golestan. Increasing awareness about the known risk factors of ESCC could potentially reduce the burden of ESCC in the region. Further studies on risk factors, identifying high risk populations, and early detection are needed.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The aim of this study was to systematically review scientific literature in orderto describe the characteristics and prognosis of malignant entities developing from odontogenic cysts. A search in Pubmed (MEDLINE) and Cochrane databases was conducted. The inclusion criteria were articles published in English related to the malignisation of odontogenic cysts in humans. The exclusion criteria were articles that do not specify the type of odontogenic cyst, malignisation of parakeratinised keratocysts, the presence of an ameloblastic carcinoma and metastasis from distant primary tumours. The selected articles were classified according to Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy criteria. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using statistical package software SPSS version 22.0. From the 1,237 articles initially obtained, the authors included 3 case series and 45 case reports in the end. Descriptive analysis showed that men have a disposition for malignisation from odontogenic cysts and they frequently appear at the posterior mandible, with pain and swelling being the most frequent signs and symptoms. Follicular cysts were the entities that underwent the most malignant changes with well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas being the most prevalent type of malignancy. The real prognosis of this malignancy is not known because of the heterogeneity of available studies. Key words:Odontogenic cysts, squamous cell carcinoma, neoplastic cell transformation, oral cancer.</text>

<text>AIM: To investigate the clinicopathological features and prognostic implications of combined MYC and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) status in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). METHODS: All patients with ESCC (n = 180) underwent surgical resection at Seoul National University Hospital sometime between 2000 and 2013. A tissue microarray was constructed using cores obtained from representative tumor areas of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. FGFR1 and MYC copy numbers were quantified using fluorescence in situ hybridization. The level of MYC expression was determined using immunohistochemistry. FGFR1 and MYC amplification status was compared between primary and metastatic lymph nodes. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed according to adjuvant therapy status. RESULTS: FGFR1 and MYC amplifications were observed in 21.4% (37/173) and 54.2% (91/168) of patients, respectively, while MYC expression was observed in 58.9% (106/180) of patients. There was a positive correlation between MYC amplification and overexpression (P = 0.002). Although FGFR1 amplification was not associated with MYC amplification or expression, 12.3% (20/163) of patients exhibited both FGFR1 amplification and MYC expression. There was also a correlation in FGFR1 amplification status between matched primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes (P &lt; 0.001). MYC expression was higher in ESCCs with pT1 (P &lt; 0.001) and in those with no lymph node metastasis (P = 0.023). MYC expression was associated with prolonged disease-free survival (P = 0.036) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.017) but was not an independent prognostic factor. FGFR1 amplification was an independent predictor for prolonged OS in all patients (P = 0.029) and in those who did not receive adjuvant therapy (P = 0.013). Combined FGFR1 amplification and MYC expression predicted better OS in patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy (P = 0.034) but not in those who did receive adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION: FGFR1 amplification and MYC expression have prognostic implications in resected ESCCs with respect to adjuvant therapy. The role of FGFR1-targeted therapy in ESCC remains to be explored.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to have important regulatory roles in human cancer biology. In our study, we found that lncRNA CCAT1, whose expression is significantly increased and is correlated with outcomes in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC). Consecutive experiments confirmed that H3K27-acetylation could activate expression of colon cancer associated transcript-1 (CCAT1). Further experiments revealed that CCAT1 knockdown significantly repressed the proliferation and migration both in vitro and in vivo RNA-seq analysis revealed that CCAT1 knockdown preferentially affected genes that are linked to cell proliferation, cell migration and cell adhesion. Mechanistic investigations found that CCAT1 could serve as a scaffold for two distinct epigenetic modification complexes (5' domain of CCAT1 binding Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) while 3' domain of CCAT1 binding SUV39H1) and modulate the histone methylation of promoter of SPRY4 (sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 4) in nucleus. In cytoplasm, CCAT1 regulates HOXB13 as a molecular decoy for miR-7, a microRNA that targets both CCAT1 and HOXB13, thus facilitating cell growth and migration. Together, our data demonstrated the important roles of CCAT1 in ESCC oncogenesis and might serve as targets for ESCC diagnosis and therapy.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Autoantibodies against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been found in many kinds of cancers, and might serve as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. The present study was carried out to test if there is any relation between autoantibodies against Fascin and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: One hundred and forty-nine patients with ESCC and 98 control subjects were recruited in the study. The levels of circulating autoantibodies against Fascin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to calculate diagnostic accuracy. RESULT: The levels of autoantibodies against Fascin in patients with ESCC were significantly higher than in control subjects (P&lt;0.001). Measurement of autoantibodies against Fascin provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.636, [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.568-0.704] 24.8% sensitivity (95% CI: 18.3%-37.2%) and 99.0% specificity (95% CI: 93.6%-99.9%). Moreover, serum level of autoantibodies against Fascin in early-stage ESCC was significantly higher than that of normal controls (P&lt;0.05). The positive rates of autoantibodies against Fascin were correlated with age (P&lt;0.05), but not with gender, tumor size, tumor site, histological grade, T stage, N stage or TNM stage (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Fascin autoantibody may be a potential biomarker for the early detection of ESCC.</text>

<offset>144</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: We report a novel use of Artegraft (North Brunswick, NJ) bovine heterograft for carotid reconstruction after resection of a neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 65 year-old man presented with a large left neck SCC encasing and invading the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA). CTA revealed an incomplete Circle of Willis on CTA and no viable vein conduit on duplex mapping. The patient underwent en bloc resection including portion of the cervical ICA followed by reconstruction with Artegraft which was well tolerated. This represents the first case reported of tumor invasion of the ICA reconstructed using Artegraft as conduit.</text>

<text>INTRODUCTION: Skin cancer treatment includes surgical and non-surgical techniques. Among surgical techniques, Mohs micrographic surgery permits a complete evaluation of surgical margins with maximal tissue sparing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of dermatology database of skin cancer cases treated with Mohs surgery at University Hospital Dr. Jos   Eleuterio Gonz  lez from 1988 to 2015. RESULTS: A total of 546 cases were included, of these 289 (52.93%) corresponded to women and 257 (47.07%) to men. Mean age at presentation was 64.3. Most tumors (63.2%) corresponded to infiltrative basal cell carcinoma and the majority were located on the nose and cheek; 9.7% of cases corresponded to recurrent tumors. A mean of 1 Mohs stages was used in 56%, with a mean of 2 sections in 23.6%. Cutaneous flaps were used in 47.7%, representing the predominant reconstruction technique. CONCLUSION: Mohs surgery has emerged in one of the dermatology reference centres in the North of the country as one of the surgical techniques for the treatment of aggressive carcinomas with high risk of recurrence.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: MCP-1/IL-6 in vitro monocyte secretion upon co-culture with autologous fragment spheroids was studied in relation to patient five- and 10-year overall survival rates in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients (N=65) diagnosed between 1998 and 2005, nine of whom had an HPV tumor infection. The spheroids were harvested from malignant or benign tissue during primary surgery. Two weeks following surgery, freshly isolated autologous monocytes and benign or malignant spheroids were co-cultured 24 hours in vitro. The IL-6 secretion was expressed as a fraction of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) response from the same batch of monocytes. HPV status was obtained by employing PCR analyses of primary diagnostic blocks. IL-6/MCP-1 response levels were not found to be dependent on HPV infection status. MCP-1 secretion did not predict prognosis, nor did in vitro IL-6 monocyte background or LPS-stimulated IL-6 secretion. At five years observation, dichotomized IL-6 levels following monocyte co-culture, with both malignant and benign spheroids, showed a strong trend towards predicting survival; i.e. a low monocyte malignant co-culture response showed a survival of 31  17% versus 58  17% with a high such response (P=0.057). When studying monocyte IL-6 co-culture responses evaluating benign and malignant spheroid results statistically together, a prediction of survival up to 10 years was found (Hazard ratio=0.48; Confidence interval=0.24-0.96; P&lt;0.05) with double low IL-6 responses. This survival prediction was also present after an adjustment for HPV tumor infection status. In conclusion, monocyte IL-6 in vitro secretion in co-cultures with autologous spheroids/serum from HNSCCs predicted five- and 10-year survivals, both with and without tumor HPV tumor adjustment.

<text>UNASSIGNED: Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary of the head and neck (SCCUP) is a heterogeneous disease entity that requires careful examination to locate the occult primary. We examined the diagnostic value of expression of biomarkers, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), p16, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), in metastatic lymph nodes versus (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18) F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). We prospectively enrolled 54 consecutive SCCUP patients who received HPV, p16, and EBV analyses of lymph node fine-needle aspirates and (18) F-FDG PET/CT scans and subsequently underwent examinations and biopsies under general anesthesia to detect primary tumors. The diagnostic performance of the biomarkers and (18) F-FDG PET/CT were compared by using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses with histopathological results for identification of primary tumors. Primary tumors were identified in 28 (51.9%) of 54 patients: the palatine tonsil in 24, base of the tongue in 1, nasopharynx in 2, and hypopharynx in 1. The sensitivity of p16 (85.7%) and accuracy of HPV (85.2%) were higher than those (42.9% and 68.5%) of (18) F-FDG PET/CT (P   &lt;   0.05). The area under the ROC curve of HPV was higher than that of (18) F-FDG PET/CT (0.857 vs. 0.666, P = 0.007). The disease-free survival rates were higher in the patients with primary tumor detection or p16 nodal immunopositivity than in the other patients (P   &lt;   0.05). The results showed that HPV and p16 detection in metastatic lymph nodes can help locate hidden primary tumors, guide definitive treatment, and predict patient survival.

<text>UNASSIGNED: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is the second most widespread cancer in humans and its incidence is rising. These tumours can evolve as poor-prognosis diseases, and therefore it is important to identify new markers to better predict its clinical evolution. Here, we identified the expression pattern of miRNAs at different stages of skin cancer progression in a panel of murine skin cancer cell lines. We determined that miR-203 and miR-205 are differentially expressed in this panel, and evaluated their potential use as biomarkers of prognosis in human tumours. MiR-205 was expressed in tumours with pathological features recognized as indicators of poor prognosis such as desmoplasia, perineural invasion and infiltrative growth pattern. MiR-205 was mainly expressed in undifferentiated areas and in the invasion front, and was associated with both local recurrence and the development of general clinical events of poor evolution. MiR-205 expression was an independent variable selected to predict events of poor clinical evolution using the multinomial logistic regression model described in this study. In contrast, miR-203 was mainly expressed in tumours exhibiting the characteristics associated with a good prognosis, was mainly present in well-differentiated zones, and rarely expressed in the invasion front. Therefore, the expression and associations of miR-205 and miR-203 were mostly mutually exclusive. Finally, using a logistic biplot we identified three clusters of patients with differential prognosis based on miR-203 and miR-205 expression, and pathological tumour features. This work highlights the utility of miRNA-205 and miRNA-203 as prognostic markers in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</text>

<text>Minimally invasive surgery versus radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy for small-volume primary oropharyngeal carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>114</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: More than 400,000 cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are diagnosed each year worldwide and the incidence is rising, partly as a result of human papillomavirus. Human papillomavirus-associated OPSCC affects younger patients and often presents at a higher stage; however, it is associated with a better prognosis.Until recently, first-line management of OPSCC involved chemoradiotherapy, as research had demonstrated comparable survival outcomes when compared with open surgery, with significantly decreased morbidity. However, interventions have now evolved with computerised planning and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and the advent of endoscopic head and neck surgery, which provide the potential for decreased treatment-associated morbidity.The oropharynx plays an essential role in swallowing, speech and protecting the airway as it is situated at the bifurcation of the respiratory and digestive tracts. Treatment modality recommendations are based on survival outcomes. Given the younger patient demographic, establishing the safety of modalities that potentially have better functional outcome is becoming increasingly important. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of endoscopic head and neck surgery (transoral robotic surgery or transoral laser microsurgery) for small-volume, primary (T1-2, N0-2) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in comparison to radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 10); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 8 November 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials in patients with carcinoma in the oropharynx subsite (as defined by the World Health Organization classification C09, C10). Cancers included were primary squamous cell carcinomas arising from the oropharyngeal mucosa. The tumours were classified as T1-T2 with or without nodal disease and with no evidence of distant metastatic spread. The intervention was transoral, minimally invasive surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The comparator was primary radiotherapy with or without induction or concurrent chemotherapy for the tumour. The treatments received and compared were of curative intent and patients had not undergone prior intervention, other than diagnostic biopsy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (disease-related mortality was to be studied where possible), locoregional control, disease-free survival and progression-free survival or time to recurrence. All outcomes were to be measured at two, three and five years after diagnosis. Our secondary outcomes included quality of life, harms associated with treatment, patient satisfaction and xerostomia score. MAIN RESULTS: No completed studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Two ongoing trials fulfilled the selection criteria, however neither are complete.'Early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: radiotherapy versus trans-oral robotic surgery (ORATOR)' is a phase II randomised controlled trial comparing primary radiation therapy with primary transoral robotic surgery for small-volume primary (T1-2, N0-2) OPSCC. It is currently in progress with an estimated completion date of June 2021.'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 1420 (EORTC 1420-HNCG-ROG)' is a phase III, randomised study assessing the "best of" radiotherapy compared to transoral robotic surgery/transoral laser microsurgery in patients with T1-T2, N0 squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and base of tongue. It was due to start accrual mid-2016. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The role of endoscopic head and neck surgery in the management of OPSCC is clearly expanding as evidenced by its more overt incorporation into the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Data are mounting regarding its outcomes both in terms of survival and lower morbidity. As confidence increases, it is being used in the management of more advanced OPSCC.Based on this review, there is currently no high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding clinical outcomes for patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving endoscopic head and neck surgery compared with primary chemoradiotherapy.</text>

<text>Melanoma and Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Associated with Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibitors, Angiotensin-Receptor Blockers and Thiazides: A Matched Cohort Study.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>164</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: Controversy exists about an association between angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and thiazides (TZs) and the risk of malignant melanoma (MM), and non-melanoma skin cancer-basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if an association exists for ACEI, ARB, or TZ exposure and skin cancers. METHODS: This was a matched cohort study using a large electronic medical records repository, the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW). The exposed population consisted of patients with a documented order for an ACEI, ARB, or TZ with no prior history of skin cancer. The control population consisted of matched patients without documented exposure to ACEI, ARB, or TZ and no previous skin cancer. Incident MM, BCC, or SCC diagnosis by ICD-9 codes was recorded. Odds ratios (ORs) were obtained by using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Among the 27,134 patients exposed to an ACEI, 87 MM, 533 BCC, and 182 SCC were detected. Among the 13,818 patients exposed to an ARB, 96 MM, 283 BCC, and 106 SCC were detected. Among the 15,166 patients exposed to a TZ, 99 MM, 262 BCC, and 130 SCC were detected. Significant associations using ORs from logistic regression were found for MM and TZs (OR 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.82); BCC and ARBs (OR 2.86; 95% CI 2.13-3.83), ACEIs (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.78-2.81) and TZs (OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.60-2.79); SCC and ARBs (OR 2.22; 95% CI 1.37-3.61), ACEIs (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.37-2.76), and TZs (OR 4.11; 95% CI 2.66-6.35). CONCLUSIONS: A safety signal for ACEIs, ARBs, and TZs and BCC and SCC, as well as for TZs and MM, was detected. An increased awareness and education, especially for those who are at high risk for skin cancer, are warranted for patients and healthcare providers. Further exploration of such associations for these commonly used drug classes is warranted.</text>

<text>PURPOSE: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) has been identified as an important component of many receptor tyrosine kinase-driven cancers. LJM716 is a human IgG monoclonal antibody that binds HER3, trapping it in an inactive conformation. In this study, a phase I dose escalation was performed with a primary objective to establish the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended dose of LJM716 in Japanese patients with selected advanced solid tumors. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of the safety and tolerability, preliminary antitumor activity, and pharmacokinetics of LJM716 in Japanese patients. METHODS: LJM716 was administered intravenously at doses of 10, 20, or 40  mg/kg once weekly, in 28-day cycles, to 12 patients with HER2-amplified breast cancer or gastric cancer, or with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, regardless of HER2 status. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and the recommended dose was established at 40  mg/kg. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the first cycle. The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, stomatitis, pyrexia, and paronychia. One unconfirmed partial response was observed in a patient with breast cancer, and 50% of the patients achieved stable disease as the best overall response. Exposure increased with ascending dose, and half-life was estimated to be 11-14  days. No anti-LJM716 antibodies were detected. CONCLUSIONS: LJM716 was well tolerated in Japanese patients, and a degree of tumor shrinkage was observed. CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01911936.</text>

<text>A Case of Squamous Cell Carcinoma in the External Auditory Canal Previously Treated for Verrucous Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>108</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Carcinoma in the external auditory canal (EAC) is a rare malignancy with an annual incidence of one per one million people, accounting for less than 0.2% of all head and neck cancers. The most common histopathological type of EAC cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. Verrucous carcinoma is a well-differentiated, low-grade variant of squamous cell carcinoma. It is a locally destructive, invasive, and slow growing tumor that rarely metastasizes. Verrucous carcinoma occurs predominantly in the oral cavity and larynx, and its occurrence in the EAC is extremely rare. In this report, we present a histologically confirmed case of verrucous carcinoma in the EAC and temporal bone, which for several years had been classified as epithelial hyperplasia. Two-and-a-half years after diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma, a recurrent mass was found and the lesion was then confirmed to be squamous cell carcinoma.</text>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>149</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of postoperative adjuvant therapy on survival of patients with intermediate risk early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: A total of 133 consecutive patients with intermediate risk early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma treated at Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute from February 2010 to March 2014 were enrolled in our study. All patients received adjuvant therapy and were subdivided into three groups: pelvic radiotherapy (RT; N=42), adjuvant chemotherapy + intracavitary radiotherapy (CT+ICRT; N=47), or concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT; N=44). Disease-free survival (DFS) and therapeutic complications were evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in DFS for patients treated with RT, CT+ICRT, and CCRT (P&gt;0.05) with 3-year rates of 94.0%, 93.4%, and 97.6%, respectively. Frequencies of grade III-IV acute toxicities were higher in patients treated with CCRT (34.1%) than those treated with RT (9.5%) or CT+ICRT (16.7%; P&lt;0.05), with no significant differences observed between RT and CT+ICRT groups (P&gt;0.05). Grade I-II late toxicities were higher in CCRT (25%), followed by RT (19.0%), and finally, the CT+ICRT group (4.3%; P&lt;0.05); with no significant differences observed between CCRT and RT groups (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Treatment with CT+ICRT or RT resulted in the equivalent of 3-year DFS compared to CCRT, but fewer therapeutic complications were observed with CT for patients with intermediate risk early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: The kinesin family member 20a (KIF20A) protein has been implicated in the development and progression of many human cancers; however, its precise function and role in cervical cancer remain largely unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression profile and prognostic value of KIF20A in patients with early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: We examined the mRNA and protein levels of KIF20A in eight cervical cancer cell lines and eight paired cervical cancer samples, compared with normal cervical epithelial cells and adjacent normal cervical tissues, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of KIF20A in paraffin-embedded specimens from 169 early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma patients. Statistical analyses were applied to analyze the association between KIF20A expression and clinical variables, as well with patient survival. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein expression levels of KIF20A were significantly elevated in cervical cancer cell lines and lesions compared with normal cells and corresponding normal tissues (P &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemistry analysis in 169 cervical cancer cases revealed that increased KIF20A expression was strongly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (P = 0.008), clinical stage (P = 0.001), tumor recurrence (P = 0.016), vital status (P &lt; 0.001), the property of the surgical margin (P = 0.032), the lymphovascular space involvement (P = 0.014), and pelvic lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001). The overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with high levels of KIF20A expression were significantly poorer than those with low KIF20A expression. KIF20A was an independent survival prognostic factor, as evidenced by univariate and multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate that elevated KIF20A expression correlates with HPV infection, clinical stage, tumor recurrence, lymphovascular space involvement, pelvic lymph node metastasis, and poor outcome in early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma patients. KIF20A aberrant expression is a novel independent unfavorable prognostic factor and may present a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: A well-studied RNA-binding protein Hu Antigen-R (HuR), controls post-transcriptional gene regulation and undergoes stress-activated caspase-3 dependent cleavage in cancer cells. The cleavage products of HuR are known to promote cell death; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms facilitating caspase-3 activation and HuR cleavage remains unknown. Here, we show that HuR cleavage associated with active caspase-3 in oral cancer cells treated with ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel. We determined that oral cancer cells overexpressing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) limited the cleavage of caspase-3 and HuR, which reduced the rate of cell death in paclitaxel resistant oral cancer cells. Specific inhibition of COX-2 by celecoxib, promoted apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of HuR in paclitaxel-resistant oral cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, oral cancer cells overexpressing cellular HuR increased the half-life of COX-2 mRNA, promoted COX-2 protein expression and exhibited enhanced tumor growth in vivo in comparison with cells expressing a cleavable form of HuR. Finally, our ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation and sequencing (RIP-seq) analyses of HuR in oral cancer cells treated with ionizing radiation (IR), determined that HuR cleavage product-1 (HuR-CP1) bound and promoted the expression of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in apoptosis. Our results indicated that, cellular non-cleavable HuR controls COX-2 mRNA expression and enzymatic activity. In addition, overexpressed COX-2 protein repressed the cleavage of caspase-3 and HuR to promote drug resistance and tumor growth. Altogether, our observations support the use of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, in combination with paclitaxel, for the management of paclitaxel resistant oral cancer cells.Oncogene advance online publication, 12 December 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.451.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated in a wide array of human cancers. The EphB4 receptor is ubiquitously expressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and has been shown to impart tumorigenic and invasive characteristics to these cancers. In this study, we investigated whether EphB4 receptor targeting can enhance the radiosensitization of HNSCC. Our data show that EphB4 is expressed at high to moderate levels in HNSCC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. We observed decreased survival fractions in HNSCC cells following EphB4 knockdown in clonogenic assays. An enhanced G2 cell cycle arrest with activation of DNA damage response pathway and increased apoptosis was evident in HNSCC cells following combined EphB4 downregulation and radiation compared to EphB4 knockdown and radiation alone. Data using HNSCC PDX models showed significant reduction in tumor volume and enhanced delay in tumor regrowth following sEphB4-HSA administration with radiation compared to single agent treatment. sEphB4-HSA is a protein known to block the interaction between the EphB4 receptor and its ephrin-B2 ligand. Overall, our findings emphasize the therapeutic relevance of EphB4 targeting as a radiosensitizer that can be exploited for the treatment of human head and neck carcinomas.</text>

<text>Metastatic lymph node ratio demonstrates better prognostic stratification than pN staging in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after esophagectomy.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>162</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of lymph node ratio (LNR) by establishing a hypothetical tumor-ratio-metastasis (TRM) staging system in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The records of 387 ESCC patients receiving curative esophagectomy were retrospectively investigated. The optimal cut-point for LNR was assessed via the best cut-off approach. Potential prognostic parameters were identified through univariate and multivariate analyses. A novel LNR-based TRM stage was proposed. The prognostic discriminatory ability and prediction accuracy of each system were determined using hazard ratio (HR), Akaike information criterion (AIC), concordance index (C-index), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The optimal cut-points of LNR were set at 0, 0~0.2, 0.2~0.4, and 0.4~1.0. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that the LNR category was an independent risk factor of overall survival (P   &lt;   0.001). The calibration curves for the probability of 3- and 5-year survival showed good consistency between nomogram prediction and actual observation. The LNR category and TRM stage yielded a larger HR, a smaller AIC, a larger C-index, and a larger AUC than the N category and TNM stage did. In summary, the proposed LNR category was superior to the conventional N category in predicting the prognosis of ESCC patients.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Over 500,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the world, resulting in 250000 deaths. Prevalence of HPV-related cervical carcinoma in Bangladesh is highest among SAARC countries. In Bangladesh very few studies have been published on establishing the correlation between histological and cytological findings on cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed to find out the correlation between histological _ cytological findings of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. In the present study, cervical smears were collected from the selected patients attending the colposcopy clinic of BSMMU from July 2011 to April 2013. Biopsy was done on colposcopically positive cases and histopathological reports were obtained. Thus 99 histologically proven cases of cervical cancer and precancerous lesion were selected. Pap smear was carried out on these 99 samples after histopathological examination. Among the 60 CIN-1 cases in histology, 18(30%) cases were diagnosed positive by Pap smear; out of 20 histologically diagnosed cases of CIN-II, only 12(60%) cases were correctly diagnosed by cytology. But in case of invasive squamous cell carcinoma 18 out of 19 were correctly diagnosed by Pap smear reaching a concordance rate of 94.74%. Overall the relation reached statistical significance (p&lt;0.05). Larger community based studies are required in this respect to find a consistent correlation between hr-HPV load and cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.</text>

<text>INTRODUCTION: Treatment of advanced stage ovarian carcinoma is challenging, and despite surgical treatment and chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate is estimated around 30%. Early recurrence and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy are associated with poor prognosis and limited response to available second-line chemotherapy. The relative incidence of endocervical adenocarcinoma (EAC) compared with squamous cell carcinoma is increasing. Although the first-line treatment modality for early stage EAC is surgical resection, for locally advanced disease chemoradiation or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used. Recently, folate along with its receptor alpha (FRA) has been studied as a potential target in gynecologic malignancy. The objective of this study was to elucidate FRA expression in chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer and primary EAC. METHODS: FRA expression was evaluated in tissue samples in an epithelial ovarian tumor microarray and 2 study groups: platinum resistant ovarian cancer and primary EAC. Staining intensity was analyzed with a semiquantitative staining algorithm. RESULTS: FRA expression was positive in 32 of 40 (80%) ovarian tumors in the control group. In the platinum resistant ovarian cancer group, FRA was expressed in all 30 samples with moderate to strong staining. None of the EAC samples stained positive for FRA expression. CONCLUSIONS: FRA expression occurs frequently in epithelial ovarian cancer. Our data supports that FRA expressions are maintained after chemotherapy treatment. Folate targeted therapies may be most useful in patients with chemotherapy resistant disease based on high levels of FRA expression in these tumors. There is likely no benefit to folate therapy as an adjuvant treatment in EAC.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND/AIMS: The lncRNA Homeobox (HOX) transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) is overexpressed in numerous cancers. HuR is also overexpressed during tumourigenesis and is abnormally present within the cytoplasm, where it binds to AU-rich elements in the 3'UTRs of target mRNA and post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of its target genes. However, whether HOTAIR is regulated and the mechanisms by which it affects head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are not well understood. METHODS: MTT, cell cycle arrest and apoptotic assays were used to examine the effects of HOTAIR and HuR on cell viability in SCC25 and FaDu cells. Wound healing and transwell invasion analysis were performed to detect the effects of HOTAIR and HuR on cell migration and invasion. The interaction between HuR and HOTAIR was confirmed via qRT-PCR, western blots, luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Finally, qRT-PCR analysis was used to detect the levels of HuR and HOTAIR in HNSCC tumours and adjacent normal tissues. RESULTS: Knockdown of HOTAIR and HuR decreased cell viability, cellular migration and invasion. Moreover, HuR interacted and stabilized HOTAIR stability and thus promoted HOTAIR expression. Notably, HOTAIR acted as a miRNA sponge for HuR. HuR also reinforced HOTAIR sponge activity through miRNA recruitment, thus enhancing HuR expression in turn. Finally, HuR and HOTAIR levels were positively correlated and significantly up-regulated in tumours samples. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the existence of a regulatory loop in which the expression of HOTAIR and HuR is reciprocally and temporally regulated during the metastasis and progression of HNSCC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Esophageal cancer is one of the common malignancies worldwide, particularly in eastern African and Asian countries including Japan. Taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) is one of the effective chemotherapeutic reagents for patients with esophageal cancer, but acquisition of chemoresistance frequently occurs; this is one of the most frequent causes for therapeutic failure. In this study, we established three taxane resistant esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and explored possible mechanisms for the acquisition of chemoresistance. Microarray analyses indicated that the ABCB1 (ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1) gene was significantly upregulated in taxane resistant esophageal cancer cell lines. Moreover, we found that siRNA mediated ABCB1 knockdown successfully restored drug sensitivity in both paclitaxel and docetaxel resistant esophageal cancer cell lines. In conclusion, we propose that ABCB1 might play a pivotal role in acquisition of taxane resistance and could be a promising target for treatment of patients with esophageal cancer after acquisition of taxane resistance.</text>

<text>Topical 1% 5-fluoruracil as a sole treatment of corneoconjunctival ocular surface squamous neoplasia: long-term study.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>118</offset>
<text>AIMS: To report long-term clinical outcome of topical 1% 5-fluoruracil (5-FU) as a sole treatment of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). METHODS: 41 patients affected by OSSN were included. Each patient underwent full ophthalmological examination at baseline, with cytological or histological confirmation. Patients were treated by topical chemotherapy with 1% 5-FU four times a day for 4   weeks. One course was defined as 4   weeks of topical chemotherapy. Adjunctive courses were administered after 1   month of chemotherapy-free interval. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 105  32   months (range 60-171 months). Complete tumour regression was achieved in 34 cases (83%) after a mean of 1.5 courses (range, 1-3 courses). Univariate analysis revealed that complete response was significantly related to tumour thickness &lt;1.5   mm (p=0.005), lack of fornix or tarsal involvement (p=0.015 and p=0.009, respectively) and the absence of multifocality (p=0.002). Histopathological diagnosis (intraepithelial neoplasia vs squamous cell carcinoma, p=0.019) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification (T1 vs T2 or T3) (p=0.028) were also related to incomplete tumour response. In a multivariate analysis, just tumour thickness &gt;1.5   mm (p=0.045) and multifocality (p=0.023) were correlated with incomplete tumour response. Transient and reversible low-to-mild local side effects were documented in 19 (48%) eyes. CONCLUSION: Topical 5-FU, as a sole therapy, is a long-term safe and effective treatment for patients affected by preinvasive OSSN and for a limited proportion (50%) of invasive OSSN.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role in the growth, progression, and metastasis of tumors. The distribution of TAMs in Kazakh esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is not determined. We aimed to investigate the role of TAMs in the occurrence and progression of Kazakh ESCC. CD163 was used as the TAM marker, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) counts were used to quantify the density of TAMs in tumor nest and surrounding stroma. IHC staining was used to evaluate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) in Kazakh ESCC and cancer adjacent normal (CAN) tissues. The density of TAMs in Kazakh ESCCs tumor nest and stromal was significantly higher than that in CAN tissues. The increased number of CD163-positive TAMs in tumor nest and tumor stromal was positively associated with Kazakh ESCC lymph node metastasis and clinical stage progression. Meanwhile, the expression of VEGF-C in Kazakh ESCCs was significantly higher than that in CAN tissues. Overexpression of VEGF-C in Kazakh ESCCs was significantly associated with gender, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis and tumor clinical stage. The increased number of TAMs, either in the tumor nests or tumor stroma was positively correlated with the overexpression of VEGF-C, which may promote lymphangiogenesis and play an important role in the invasion and metastasis of Kazakh ESCC.</text>

<text>Utility of the Roche Cobas 4800 for Detection of High-Risk Human Papillomavirus in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>

<offset>154</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Clinical laboratories are expected to reliably identify human papilloma virus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) for prognostic and potential therapeutic applications. In addition to surrogate p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing, DNA-based HPV-specific testing strategies are widely utilized. Recognizing the efficiency of the Roche Cobas 4800 platform for testing gynecological cytology specimens for high-risk HPV, we elected to evaluate the potential utility of this platform for testing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) OPSCC tissue. Using the Roche Linear Array assay for comparison, we tested twenty-eight samples (16 primary OPSCC, 2 lymph node metastases from primary OPSCC, 1 oral tongue carcinoma, 3 benign squamous papillomas, and 3 non-oropharyngeal carcinoma tissues). Excluding two invalid results, the Roche Cobas 4800 testing resulted in excellent inter-assay concordance (25/26, 96.2%) and 100% concordance for HPV-16/HPV-18 positive samples. This data suggests that the Roche Cobas 4800 platform may be a cost-effective method for testing OPSCC FFPE tissues in a clinical molecular pathology laboratory setting.</text>

<text>The administration of multipotent stromal cells at precancerous stage precludes tumor growth and epithelial dedifferentiation of oral squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>158</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) are envisioned as a powerful therapeutic tool. As they home into tumors, secrete trophic and vasculogenic factors, and suppress immune response their role in carcinogenesis is a matter of controversy. Worldwide oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the fifth most common epithelial cancer. Our aim was to determine whether MSC administration at precancerous stage modifies the natural progression of OSCC. OSCC was induced in Syrian hamsters by topical application of DMBA in the buccal pouch. At papilloma stage, the vehicle or 3*10(6) allogenic bone marrow-derived MSCs were locally administered. Four weeks later, the lesions were studied according to: volume, stratification (histology), proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (Caspase 3 cleaved), vasculature (ASMA), inflammation (Leukocyte infiltrate), differentiation (CK1 and CK4) and gene expression profile (mRNA). Tumors found in individuals that received MSCs were smaller than those presented in the vehicle group (87  80 versus 54  62mm(3), p&lt;0.05). The rate of proliferation was two times lower and the apoptosis was 2.5 times higher in lesions treated with MSCs than in untreated ones. While the laters presented dedifferentiated cells, the former maintained differentiated cells (cytokeratin and gene expression profile similar to normal tissue). Thus, MSC administration at papilloma stage precludes tumor growth and epithelial dedifferentiation of OSCC.</text>

<text>The association between human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal squamous cell Carcinoma: Reviewed according to the Bradford Hill criteria for causality.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>151</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: There is emerging evidence of the association between human papillomavirus and a subset of head and neck cancers. However, the role of human papillomavirus as a causal factor is still debated. This review addresses the association between human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma using the Bradford Hill criteria. The strength of the association is supported by, detection of human papillomavirus infection and antibodies prior to oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. This is furthermore reinforced by the absence of human papillomavirus DNA in healthy tonsils. The association is geographically consistent throughout the economically developed world. The presence and integration of high-risk human papillomavirus genome in tonsillar tumours, and expression of viral oncogenes, are specific and plausible. Analogous to human papillomavirus in cervical cancer, the rising incidence in human papillomavirus positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is associated with sexual behaviour. These associations have been repeatedly observed and are in accordance with our current knowledge. The time relation between cause and effect remains the main challenge, due to the lack of well-defined premalignant lesions. However, a causal relationship between human papillomavirus infection and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma seems evident.</text>

<offset>68</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Radiation therapy plays an essential role in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), yet therapeutic efficacy is hindered by treatment-associated toxicity and tumor recurrence. In comparison to other cancers, innovation has proved challenging, with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody cetuximab being the only new radiosensitizing agent approved by the FDA in over half a century. This review examines the physiological mechanisms that contribute to radioresistance in HNSCC as well as preclinical and clinical data regarding novel radiosensitizing agents, with an emphasis on those with highest translational promise.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between polymorphisms of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and toxicity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients treated with cetuximab. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective, observational pilot study which included 110 patients with histologically-confirmed human papillomavirus (HPV) negative HNSCC in locally advanced stages (III-IVA-B) and who were treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy plus cetuximab between 2003 and 2013. Genetic analyses for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes EGFR, CCDN1, FCGR2A, FCGR3A and KRAS-LCS6 were performed though available allelic discrimination assay and/or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. RESULTS: Acneiform rash was observed in 55.5% of patients, dry skin in 45.5% and pruritus in 20.9%. A significant association with dry skin and global cetuximab-related toxicity was observed for the KRAS-LCS6 (rs61764370) variant (p&lt;0.05); carriers of the G allele (genotypes TG+GG) in the dominant model were observed to have a decreased susceptibility of developing dry skin (OR=0.287 [95%CI=0.119-0.695]). Carriers of the A (GA+AA) allele for EGFR (rs2227983) showed a decreased risk of suffering from pruritus (OR=0.345 [0.124-0.958]). Similarly, KRAS (rs1801274) was related with lower global cetuximab-related toxicity (OR=0.266 [0.114-0.622]). CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides preliminary evidence supporting genetic variation of EGFR (rs2227983), KRAS (rs61764370) and FCGR2A (rs180127) as useful biomarkers for predicting reduced skin toxicity in HNSCC patients treated with a cetuximab-based therapy. Alternative therapeutic options should be explored for these patients.</text>

<text>Circulating miRNAs from blood, plasma or serum as promising clinical biomarkers in oral squamous cell carcinoma: A systematic review of current findings.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>153</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize current findings on the use of circulating miRNAs from blood, serum and plasma as cancer biomarkers in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. Studies were gathered after searching four different electronic databases: PUBMED, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Additional search was carried out through cross check on bibliography of selected articles. After the selection process made by two of the authors, 16 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Results showed that circulating miRNAs from blood, serum or plasma represent promising candidates as cancer biomarkers in patients suffering from oral cancer. The possibility to predict recurrences and metastases through follow-up quantification of candidate miRNAs represents another potential feature to be addressed in future studies. However, methodological standardization and uniform sampling is needed to increase the power and accuracy of results.</text>

<text>HPV knowledge gaps and information seeking by oral cancer patients.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>67</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) continues to increase over time, challenging healthcare providers to address their patients' HPV-related concerns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study assessed health literacy, HPV knowledge, utilization and trust in information sources among patients with incident HPV-positive or HPV-negative OSCC diagnosed at the Ohio State University from 2011 to 2015. Health literacy was assessed with a standardized scale. Additional questions evaluated HPV knowledge (including transmission, prevalence, health consequences and treatment), the frequency and type of information sources sought, and trust in those sources. RESULTS: Surveys were collected from 372 OSCC cases (HPV-positive, n=188; HPV-negative, n=184). Despite high mean health literacy scores, only 45.2% of HPV-related knowledge questions were answered correctly. HPV was known to be a sexually transmitted infection and a cause of cervical and anal cancer by 66.0%, 56.5% and 15.2%, respectively. In all domains, cases with HPV-positive OSCC were significantly more informed than HPV-negative cases (for all, p&lt;0.01). Only 52.7% and 56.2% of patients with HPV-positive OSCC felt they knew enough to be comfortable discussing HPV with their doctor or sexual partner, respectively. The most frequently used information source was the internet (80.9%), which ranked 8th in trust of 15 possible sources. Although most (95.5%) patients trusted information from their doctors, only 37.9% used doctors as an information source. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors are a highly trusted, but infrequent utilized, information source and should facilitate patient access to high-quality HPV information sources.</text>

<text>The Oncologic Outcome of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients After  Robot-Assisted Thoracoscopic Esophagectomy With Total Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>158</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The oncologic outcome of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients after robot-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy (RATE) with total mediastinal lymphadenectomy (ML) has not been reported. This study was performed to determine the oncologic outcome of RATE and the effectiveness of total ML for ESCC. METHODS: The 115 patients who underwent RATE without neoadjuvant therapy from 2006 to 2014 were reviewed. The efficacy index (EI) was calculated by  multiplying the incidence of metastasis by the 3-year survival rate of the patients for each node station. RESULTS: The majority of patients were male (92.2%), and the mean age was 63.2    0.8 years. Tumor location was the upper esophagus in 12 patients (10.4%), the middle esophagus in 59 patients (51.3%), and the lower esophagus in 44 patients (38.3%). R0 resection was achieved in 110 (95.7%) patients; the mean number of dissected nodes was 49.0    1.9. Operative mortalities were 4 (3.5%) cases; in the remaining 111 patients, the mean follow-up time was 32.4    2.2 months. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free interval (RFI) at 3 years were 85.0% and 79.4%, respectively. The 3-year OS and RFI were 94.4% and 96.2% in patients with stage I disease, 86.2% and 80.1% in stage II disease, and 77.8% and 79.5% in stage IIIA disease, respectively. High EI values were determined in the bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) nodes in upper and middle ESCC, and in the left gastric and paracardial nodes in lower ESCC. CONCLUSIONS: The oncologic outcome of RATE was acceptable. Total ML, including dissection of the RLN nodes, is recommended especially in upper or middle ESCC.</text>

<text>Surveillance of patients at high-risk of squamous cell esophageal cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>73</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Currently curative treatment for esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) is possible only in patients with early-stage, usually asymptomatic disease. In Western countries, where the incidence of ESCC is relatively low, a screening of asymptomatic, average-risk population is untenable. In order to detect early-stage ESCC or its precursor lesions it is important to identify high-risk patients and consider endoscopic surveillance in these groups. These high-risk groups include patients after curative treatment for head and neck cancer, previous endoscopic resection of ESCC, caustic injury, and patients with tylosis or achalasia. This paper discuss the evidence and proposed method of endoscopy surveillance of these high-risk patients.</text>

<offset>112</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Purpose Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) is characterized by high locoregional failure (LRF) rates after definitive chemoradiation (CRT), associated with anogenital human papilloma virus, and often appears in HIV infection. Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal SCC, we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC. Methods Forty-five patients with stage I to III SCCAC and HIV infection received CRT: 45 to 54 Gy radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab and two cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil. The study was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in 3-year LRF rate (one-sided a, 0.10; power, 90%), assuming a 35% LRF rate from historical data. Results The 3-year LRF rate was 42% (95% CI, 28% to 56%; one-sided P = .9) by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point (LRF or alive without LRF and followed &lt; 3 years), and 20% (95% CI, 10% to 37%) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in post hoc analysis using definitions and methods consistent with historical data. Three-year rates by Kaplan-Meier estimate were 72% (95% CI, 56% to 84%) for progression-free survival and 79% (95% CI, 63% to 89%) for overall survival. Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 26%, and 4% had treatment-associated deaths. Conclusion HIV-associated SCCAC is potentially curable with definitive CRT. Although addition of cetuximab may result in less LRF, the 20% recurrence and 26% grade 4 toxicity rates indicate the continued need for more-effective and less-toxic therapies.</text>

<text>Bronchial airway gene expression signatures in mouse lung squamous cell carcinoma and their modulation by cancer chemopreventive agents.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>136</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Due to exposure to environmental toxicants, a "field cancerization" effect occurs in the lung resulting in the development of a field of initiated but morphologically normal appearing cells in the damaged epithelium of bronchial airways with dysregulated gene expression patterns. Using a mouse model of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to profile bronchial airway gene expression and found activation of the PI3K and Myc signaling networks in cytologically normal bronchial airway epithelial cells of mice with preneopastic lung SCC lesions, which was reversed by treatment with the PI3K Inhibitor XL-147 and pioglitazone, respectively. Activated MYC signaling was also present in premalignant and tumor tissues from human lung SCC patients. In addition, we identified a key microRNA, mmu-miR-449c-5p, whose suppression significantly up-regulated Myc expression in the normal bronchial airway epithelial cells of mice with early stage SCC lesions. We developed a novel bronchial genomic classifier in mice and validated it in humans. In the classifier, Ppbp (pro-platelet basic protein) was overexpressed 115 fold in the bronchial airways of mice with preneoplastic lung SCC lesions. This is the first report that demonstrates Ppbp as a novel biomarker in the bronchial airway for lung cancer diagnosis.</text>

<text>Outcome and cervical metastatic spread of squamous cell cancer of the buccal mucosa, a retrospective analysis of the past 25 years.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>131</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: Because of the low proportion of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the buccal mucosa within the carcinomas of the oral cavity in the western population, data concerning metastatic pattern are sparse. Therefore, this retrospective study is focusing on the occurrence of cervical metastases (CM) and the overall outcome of this tumor entity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1988 to October 2013, 113 patients were treated in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Mainz for an oral SCC of the cheek. Metastatic pattern and clinical parameters that are possibly associated with an increased risk for CM as well as overall outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: The average follow-up was 48 months (range: 1-248 months). 55 (49%) patients were female, and 58 (51%) male, with an average age of 65  13 years (   68  14ys;    63  11ys). 55% of the patients either smoked and/or consumed alcohol. 34% of the patients had a stage III or IV tumor, with overall 23% having CM at the time of diagnosis. During the follow-up, 50% (n=56) of the patients developed a relapse after 12 months (median). Tumor size (p=0.002*) and grading (p&lt;0.001*) are significant associated with the occurrence of CM. Metastases (p=0.008*) and advanced tumor size (p=0.018) had an influence on the survival, whereas the relapse had no significant influence (p=0.928). 5-year survival rate was 80%. CONCLUSIONS: SCC of the buccal mucosa shows aggressive behavior with a considerably high proportion of relapse. Since overall outcome is significantly decreased by the cervical metastatic pattern, a selective, ipsilateral neck dissection for this patient group is recommended as the primary management.

<text>Differences in Survival Outcome between Oropharyngeal and Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma in relation to HPV Status.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>120</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: This study examined the prognostic significance of human papillomavirus (HPV) in patients with oropharyngeal and oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: Tissue microarrays were constructed from oropharyngeal and oral cavity SCC (n=143). The presence of functional HPV in tumour was determined by combined assessments of p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV in-situ hybridisation. RESULTS: Oropharyngeal SCC patients presented with more advanced disease in comparison to oral cavity SCC patients (p=0.001). HPV is present in 60% and 61% of oropharyngeal and oral cavity SCC patients respectively. HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC patients with advanced TNM stages displayed better overall and disease free survival outcomes than HPV-negative patients (p=0.022 and 0.046 respectively). Such survival differences were not observed in oral cavity SCC. CONCLUSIONS: HPV is common in both oropharyngeal and oral cavity SCC and is associated with better survival outcome in oropharyngeal SCC but not in oral cavity SCC patients.

<text>OBJECTIVE: Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 has been well-studied in the progression of many malignancies. However, its association with the radioresistance of tumors has not been well-understood yet. This study tried to explore the role of MALAT1 in regulating the radiosensitivity of esophageal cancer (EC), especially esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), involving its regulation on Cks1 expression. METHODS: KYSE150 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into nude mice to establish ESCC xenografts. Real time PCR and western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression of MALAT1 and Cks1 in irradiated xenografts and cells. Functional analysis were performed in both EC9706 and KYSE150 cells via the transfection of corresponding plasmids or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Irradiation-induced damage was examined by the detection of cell viability and apoptosis using MTT and TUNEL assays respectively. RESULTS: Both MALAT1 and Cks1 were downregulated in irradiated xenografts and cells. Cks1FER1L4 showed significantly downregulation. Overexpression of MALAT1 inhibited irradiation-induced decrease of cell viability, increase of apoptosis and downregulation of Cks1. Cks1 expression was also downregulated by MALAT1 siRNA, while Cks1 siRNA strongly recovered MALAT1-induced radioresistance in vitro. Moreover, better tumor growth, accompanied by Cks1 upregulation, was observed in KYSE150 xenografts with MALAT1 overexpression, especially under radiation treatment. CONCLUSION: MALAT1 acted as one positive regulator of the radioresistance of ESCC, at least partly due to its promotion on Cks1 expression. Furthermore, MALAT1-targeted therapies showed great potential in enhancing the radiotherapeutic effect on ESCC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</text>

<text>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in a case-control study of oral squamous cell carcinoma and its increasing trend in northeastern Thailand.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>143</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an independent risk factor for development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study aimed to investigate the role of HPV infection and the trend in percentage of HPV-associated OSCC over a 5-year period in northeastern Thailand. In this case-control study, 91 exfoliated oral cell samples and 80 lesion cell samples from OSCC cases and exfoliated oral cells from 100 age/gender-matched controls were collected. HPV infection was investigated by PCR using GP5+/GP6+ primers followed by HPV genotyping using reverse line blot hybridization. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate HPV oncogene transcription. Temporal trends of HPV infection were evaluated in archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) OSCC tissues using in situ hybridization. HPV DNA was found in 17.5% (14/80) of lesion samples from OSCC cases and 29.7% (27/91) of exfoliated oral cell samples from the same cases. These values were significantly higher than in exfoliated oral cell samples from controls (13%, 13/100). HPV-16 was the genotype most frequently found in OSCC cases (92.8%, 13/14 infected cases). Interestingly, HPV oncogene mRNA expression was detected and correlated with OSCC cases (P   &lt;   0.005). Of 146 archived FFPE OSCC samples, 82 (56.2%) were positive for high-risk HPV DNA and 64 (43.8%) cases were positive for HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression. There was a trend of increasing percentage of HPV-associated OSCC from 2005 to 2010. This was especially so for females with well-differentiated tumors in specific tongue sub-sites. We suggest that HPV infection plays an important role in oral carcinogenesis in northeastern Thailand.</text>

<text>Integrated Analysis and microRNA Expression Profiling Identified Seven miRNAs Associated With Progression of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>138</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: MicroRNAs have been used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for many cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Several studies have been shown that microRNA (miRNA) play important roles during the progression of OSCC. However, the results vary largely in different studies due to different platforms and sample sizes. In this study, we systematically evaluated a large scale of miRNA profiles from current qualified OSCC samples, and further investigated the functions of genes regulated by these key miRNAs as well as the signaling pathways through which these miRNA effect carcinogenesis. Seven key miRNAs were identified, and of which 3 were significantly up-regulated, including hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-338, and 4 were down-regulated, namely hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-133a, hsa-miR-133b and hsa-miR-139. The function enrichment analysis revealed that target genes of up-regulated miRNAs were associated with cellular protein metabolic process, macromolecule metabolic process and TGF-beta pathway, while the targets of down-regulated were enriched in negative regulation of macromolecule biosynthetic process and gene expression, and p53, Long-term potentiation and adherens junction pathways. Transcription factor analysis revealed that there were 67 (51.1%) transcription factors influenced by both up and down-regulated miRNAs. To summary, 7 key miRNAs were found to play essential role in progression of OSCC, as well as the target genes and transcription factors of these miRNAs. The potential functions of these target genes identified in our study may be profitable to diagnosis and prognostic prediction of OSCC as biomarkers. This article is protected by copyright.

<text>UNASSIGNED: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is generalized term that encompasses a diverse group of cancers that includes tumours of the oral cavity (OSCC), oropharynx (OPSCC) and nasopharynx (NPC). Genetic alterations that are common to all HNSCC types are likely to be important for squamous carcinogenesis. In this study, we have investigated the role of the homeodomain-only homeobox gene, HOPX, in the pathogenesis of HNSCC. We show that HOPX mRNA levels are reduced in OSCC and NPC cell lines and tissues and there is a general reduction of HOPX protein expression in these tumours and OPSCCs. HOPX promoter methylation was observed in a subset of HNSCCs and was associated with a worse overall survival in HPV negative tumours. RNAseq analysis of OSCC cells transfected with HOPX revealed a widespread deregulation of the transcription of genes related to epithelial homeostasis and ectopic over-expression of HOPX in OSCC and NPC cells inhibited cell proliferation, plating efficiency and migration, and enhanced sensitivity to UVA-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that HOPX functions as a tumour suppressor in HNSCC and suggest a central role for HOPX in suppressing epithelial carcinogenesis.</text>

<text>Outcomes and prognostic factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue in young adults: a single-institution case-matched analysis.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>139</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: There is controversy regarding prognosis and treatment of young patients with oral cavity cancer compared to their older counterparts. We conducted a retrospective case-matched analysis of all adult patients younger than 40  years and treated at our institution for a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Only non-metastatic adult patients (age &gt;18) with oral tongue cancer were eventually included and matched 1:1 with patients over 40  years of age, at least 20  years older than the cases, with same T and N category and treatment period. Sixty-three patients younger than 40 had an oral cavity squamous cell cancer out of which 57 had an oral tongue primary during the period 1999-2012, and 50 could be matched with an older control. No difference could be seen between younger and older patients with regard to overall, cancer-specific, or progression-free survival. The patterns of failure were similar, although in young patients, almost all failures occurred during the first 2  years following treatment. Although overall survival shows a trend toward lower survival in older patients, cancer-specific survival and analysis of pattern failure suggest that disease prognosis is similar between young and older adults with oral tongue cancer. Further work is needed to identify the younger patients with poorer prognosis who overwhelmingly fail during the first year after treatment and could benefit from treatment intensification. Until then, young adults ought to be treated using standard guidelines.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are more than 200 nucleotides in length and lack transcriptional ability. The biological function of lncRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the dysfunction of lncRNA in OSCC. RESULTS: We analyzed the transcriptome profiles of human OSCC tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues from two patients through a next-generation sequencing approach. A total of 14 lncRNAs were upregulated (fold change &gt;= 3) and 13 were downregulated (fold change &lt;= -3) in OSCC tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. SOX21-AS1 was subjected to further analysis, revealing that the expression levels of SOX21-AS1 significantly decreased in OSCC compared with the adjacent normal tissue. The promoter activity of SOX21-AS1 was obviously suppressed by in vitro methylation. The DNA methylation status of the SOX21-AS1 promoter was analyzed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis, revealing that the aberrant promoter hypermethylation of SOX21-AS1 was observed frequently in OSCC tissues. The effects of SOX21-AS1 on cell proliferation and invasion were examined through transient transfection. Our data showed that SOX21-AS1 could significantly suppress oral cancer cell growth and invasion. Furthermore, the low expression level of SOX21-AS1 was significantly correlated with an advanced stage (P   =   0.047), large tumor size (P   =   0.033), and poor disease-specific survival in OSCC patients (P   =   0.002). CONCLUSIONS: SOX21-AS1 was identified as susceptible dysfunction correlated with promoter hypermethylation in OSCC. Low SOX21-AS1 expression may be an adverse prognostic biomarker for OSCC.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I-alpha regulatory subunit (PRKAR1a) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its correlation with clinicopathological features.    Methods: PRKAR1a expressions in 79 NSCLC patients and matched adjacent non-carcinoma tissues were analyzed by using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.    Results: The negative rates of PRKAR1a protein in NSCLC, lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCL) and lung adenocarcinoma (ACL) were 58.2%, 77.8%, 32.4%, respectively. Compared to the matched adjacent non-carcinoma tissues, there were significant differences in levels of PRKAR1a mRNA and protein in ACL (P&lt;0.05), but not in SCL and overall NSCLC (P&gt;0.05). The expression of PRKAR1a protein was positively correlated with histological type, TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis (P&lt;0.05). Tumor size and histogenesis differentiation were not related to the decreased PRKAR1a (P&gt;0.05).    Conclusion: Low expression of PRKAR1a in ACL might be involved in the pathogenesis, which might serve as a novel diagnostic candidate.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The most common histological classification of bile duct cancer is adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is relatively rare. We report a case of a 78-year-old man with SCC of the extrahepatic bile duct associated with metachronous para-aortic lymph node metastasis. He had undergone subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. The pathological findings demonstrated moderately differentiated SCC of the distal extrahepatic bile duct (T1N1M0, stage IIB). 6   months after surgery, recurrence of the para-aortic lymph node was shown in abdominal CT. 5 courses of tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (S-1) plus cisplatin therapy was performed and the para-aortic lymph node disappeared, confirmed as complete response by imaging findings. The patient is alive without recurrence, 10   months after recurrence and chemotherapy.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Upregulation of eIF4E is associated with poor clinical outcome in many human cancers and represents a potential therapeutic target. However, the function of eIF4E remains unknown in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC). In this work, we show that ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, effectively augments sensitivity of OTSCC cells to paclitaxel via inhibiting mTOR/eIF4E signaling pathway. Ribavirin dose-dependently inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in SCC-9 and CAL27  cells. Combination of ribavirin and paclitaxel are more effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in OTSCC cells. Importantly, the in  vivo efficacy of ribavirin and its synergism with paclitaxel is confirmed by two independent OTSCC xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, ribavirin significantly decreases mTOR/eIF4E signaling pathway in OTSCC cells via suppressing phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, 4EBP1 and eIF4E. Overexpression of the phosphor-mimetic form of eIF4E (eIF4E S209D) but not the nonphosphorylatable form (eIF4E S209A) reverses the effects of ribavirin, confirming that eIF4E inhibition is the mechanism of action of ribavirin in OTSCC cells. In addition, eIF4E depletion significantly enhances the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of paclitaxel, demonstrating the critical role of eIF4E in OTSCC cell response to paclitaxel. Our work is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of ribavirin as a single agent and synergism as combination with paclitaxel in OTSCC in  vitro and in  vivo. Our findings also demonstrate the therapeutic value of inhibiting eIF4E in OTSCC treatment.</text>

<text>[Hereditary epidermolysis bullosa: French national guidelines (PNDS) for diagnosis and treatment].</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>98</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Hereditary epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a heterogeneous group of rare genetic diseases characterized by fragile skin and/or mucous membrane, and it may be either local or generalized. It is caused by mutations in genes encoding different proteins involved mainly in the structure and function of the dermal-epidermal junction. Nineteen genes have so far been identified. They are classified by level of skin cleavage (from top to bottom) into four groups: EB simplex, junctional EB, dystrophic EB and Kindler syndrome. Clinically suspected diagnosis is confirmed by immunohistochemical examination of a skin biopsy at specialized centres in order to determine the level of cleavage and the deficient protein. This first step may be followed by genetic analysis. The severity of the disease is highly variable, ranging from localized forms with little effect on quality of life to rapidly lethal forms. In generalized severe forms, the extent and chronicity of lesions, as well as mucosal involvement, can lead to systemic complications: malnutrition, pain, joint contractures, chronic inflammation, amyloidosis, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Some specific forms are associated with other cutaneous signs (nail involvement, alopecia, hyperpigmentation, palmoplantar keratoderma) or extracutaneous involvement (muscular dystrophy or pyloric atresia). No curative treatment of EB is available today. EB requires multidisciplinary medical care, nursing, psychological and social management. This is best provided by a specialized network, involving reference centres, centres of expertise and daily caregivers. The goal of treatment is the prevention and treatment of lesions with specific non-adherent dressings and the prevention, detection and treatment of complications. It is essential not to traumatize the skin (bandaging, friction, etc.). Protein, gene or cell replacement therapy, and allogeneic bone marrow, cord blood or pluripotent stem-cell transplantation are currently being assessed. The aim of these French recommendations (national diagnostic and treatment protocol [PNDS]) is to provide healthcare professionals with guidance on the course of EB and on optimal patient management.</text>

<text>PDGF-AA mediates mesenchymal stromal cell chemotaxis to the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumor microenvironment.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>121</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The robust desmoplasia associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) suggests that the tumor microenvironment may be an important component in the pathophysiology of this cancer. Moreover, the high recurrence rate and poor clinical response to chemotherapy and radiation treatment further underscores that the non-cancerous cells of the microenvironment, such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and pericytes, may be important in the pathophysiology of HNSCC. METHODS: Confocal microscopy and immunohistomchemistry approaches were used to identify MSCs tumor microenvironment from patients with oral cavity and oral pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In vitro Boyden chamber assays and multiplex magnetic bead assays were used to measure MSC chemotaxis and to identify the chemokines secreted by JHU-011, -012, -019, three cells lines derived from patients with oral pharyngeal SCC. RESULTS: We show here that MSCs reside in the tumor microenvironment of patients with oral cavity and oral pharyngeal SCC and are recruited via paracrine mediated tumor cell secretion of (platelet derived growth factor) PDGF-AA. The MSC markers CD90(+), CD105(+), and gremlin-1(+) were found to co-localize on cells within the tumor microenvironment in oral cavity SCC specimens distinct from a-smooth muscle actin staining CAFs. The conditioned media from JHU-011, -012, and -019 caused a significant increase in MSC migration (&gt;60%) and invasion (&gt;50%; p  &lt;  0.0001) compared to oral keratinocyte (OKT) controls. Tumor cell induced MSC chemotaxis appears to be mediated through paracrine secretion of PDGF-AA as inhibition of the PDGF-AA receptor, PDGFR-a but not PDGFR-b, resulted in near arrest of MSC chemotaxis (p  &lt;  0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor microenvironment expression of PDGFR-a has been shown to correlate with a worse prognosis in patients with prostate, breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer and osteosarcoma. This is the first evidence that a similar signaling paradigm may be present in HNSCC. PDGFR-a inhibitors have not been studied as adjunctive treatment options in the management of HNSCC and may prove to be an important driver of the malignant phenotype in this setting.</text>

<text>Heterogeneity of Glucose Metabolism in Esophageal Cancer Measured by Fractal Analysis of Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography Image: Correlation between Metabolic Heterogeneity and Survival.</text>
</passage>

<offset>201</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Intratumoral heterogeneity is a well-recognized characteristic feature of cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess the heterogeneity of the intratumoral glucose metabolism using fractal analysis, and evaluate its prognostic value in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies of 79 patients who received curative surgery were evaluated. FDG-PET images were analyzed using fractal analysis software, where differential box-counting method was employed to calculate the fractal dimension (FD) of the tumor lesion. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and FD were compared with overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The median SUVmax and FD of ESCCs in this cohort were 13.8 and 1.95, respectively. In univariate analysis performed using Cox's proportional hazard model, T stage and FD showed significant associations with OS (p = 0.04, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively), while SUVmax did not (p = 0.1). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the low FD tumor (&lt;1.95) showed a significant association with favorable OS (p &lt; 0.0001). In wthe multivariate analysis among TNM staging, serum tumor markers, FD, and SUVmax, the FD was identified as the only independent prognostic factor for OS (p = 0.0006; hazards ratio 0.251, 95% CI 0.104-0.562). CONCLUSION: Metabolic heterogeneity measured by fractal analysis can be a novel imaging biomarker for survival in patients with ESCC.</text>

<text>Differences in the Prevalence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancers by Sex, Race, Anatomic Tumor Site, and HPV Detection Method.</text>
</passage>

<text>Importance: Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes an increasing proportion of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs), particularly in white men. The prevalence of HPV among other demographic groups and other anatomic sites of HNSCC is unclear. Objective: To explore the role of HPV tumor status among women and nonwhites with OPSCC and patients with nonoropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (non-OP HNSCC). Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study at 2 tertiary academic centers including cases diagnosed 1995 through 2012, oversampled for minorities and females. A stratified random sample of 863 patients with newly diagnosed SCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or nasopharynx was used. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were HPV status as measured by p16 immunohistochemical analysis, HPV16 DNA in situ hybridization (ISH), and high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA ISH. Results: Of 863 patients, 551 (63.9%) were male and median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 51-68 years). Among 240 OPSCCs, 144 (60%) were p16 positive (p16+), 115 (48%) were HPV16 DNA ISH positive (ISH16+), and 134 (56%) were positive for any oncogenic HPV type (ISH+). From 1995 to 2012, the proportion of p16+ OPSCC increased significantly among women (from 29% to 77%; P   =   .005 for trend) and men (36% to 72%; P   &lt;   .001 for trend), as well as among whites (39% to 86%; P   &lt;   .001 for trend) and nonwhites (32% to 62%; P   =   .02 for trend). Similar results were observed for ISH+ OPSCC (P   &lt;=    .01 for all). Among 623 non-OP HNSCCs, a higher proportion were p16+ compared with ISH positive (62 [10%] vs 30 [5%]; P   =   .001). A high proportion (26 of 62 [42%]) of these p16+ non-OP HNSCCs were found in sites adjacent to the oropharynx. The proportion of p16+ and ISH+ non-OP HNSCCs were similar by sex. Over time, the proportion of non-OP HNSCCs that were p16+ (or ISH+) increased among whites (P   =   .04 for trend) but not among nonwhites (each P   &gt; .51 for trend). Among OPSCCs, p16 had high sensitivity (100%), specificity (91%), and positive (93%) and negative predictive value (100%) for ISH positivity. In non-OP HNSCCs, p16 had lower sensitivity (83%) and positive predictive value (40%) but high specificity (94%) and negative predictive value (99%) for ISH positivity. Conclusions and Relevance: During 1995 through 2012, the proportion of OPSCCs caused by HPV has increased significantly. This increase was not restricted to white men but was a consistent trend for women and men, as well as for white and nonwhite racial groups. Few non-OP HNSCCs were HPV related. P16 positivity was a good surrogate for ISH+ tumor status among OPSCC, but not a good surrogate for non-OP HNSCC.</text>

<text>Effect of Standard Radiotherapy With Cisplatin vs Accelerated Radiotherapy With Panitumumab in Locoregionally Advanced Squamous Cell Head and Neck Carcinoma: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>186</offset>
<text>Importance: The Canadian Cancer Trials Group study HN.6 is the largest randomized clinical trial to date comparing the concurrent administration of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies with radiotherapy (RT) to standard chemoradiotherapy in locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN). Objective: To compare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with LA-SCCHN treated with standard-fractionation RT plus high-dose cisplatin vs accelerated-fractionation RT plus the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized phase 3 clinical trial in 17 Canadian centers. A total of 320 patients were randomized between December 2008 and November 2011. Interventions: Patients with TanyN+M0 or T3-4N0M0 LA-SCCHN were randomized 1:1 to receive standard-fractionation RT (70 Gy/35 over 7 weeks) plus cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 intravenous for 3 doses (arm A) vs accelerated-fractionation RT (70 Gy/35 over 6 weeks) plus panitumumab at 9 mg/kg intravenous for 3 doses (arm B). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary end point was PFS. Due to an observed declining event rate, the protocol was amended to a time-based analysis. Secondary end points included overall survival, local and regional PFS, distant metastasis-free survival, quality of life, adverse events, and safety. Results: Of 320 patients randomized (268 [84%] male; median age, 56 years), 156 received arm A and 159 arm B. A total of 93 PFS events occurred. By intention-to-treat, 2-year PFS was 73% (95% CI, 65%-79%) in arm A and 76% (95% CI, 68%-82%) in arm B (hazard ratio [HR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.60-1.50; P   =   .83). The upper bound of the HR 95% CI exceeded the prespecified noninferiority margin. Two-year overall survival was 85% (95% CI, 78%-90%) in arm A and 88% (95% CI, 82%-92%) in arm B (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.54-1.48; P   =   .66). Incidence of any grade 3 to 5 nonhematologic adverse event was 88% in arm A and 92% in arm B (P   =   .25). Conclusions and Relevance: With a median follow-up of 46 months, the PFS of panitumumab plus accelerated-fractionation RT was not superior to cisplatin plus standard-fractionation RT in LA-SCCHN and noninferiority was not proven. Despite having negative results, HN.6 has contributed important data regarding disease control and toxic effects of these treatment strategies. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00820248.</text>

<text>Transoral Robotic Surgery-Assisted Endoscopy With Primary Site Detection and Treatment in Occult Mucosal Primaries.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>115</offset>
<text>Importance: Management of cervical lymph node metastasis without a known primary tumor is a diagnostic and treatment challenge for head and neck oncologists. Identification of the occult mucosal primary tumor minimizes the morbidity of treatment. Objective: To analyze the role of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in facilitating the identification of a primary tumor site for patients presenting with squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP). In addition, we assessed treatment deintensification by determining the number of patients who did not undergo definitive radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective case series from January 2011 to September 2015, 60 consecutive patients with squamous cell CUP who underwent TORS-assisted endoscopy and ipsilateral neck dissection were included from an academic medical center and studied to study the rate success rate of TORS identifying occult mucosal malignancy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Success rate of identifying occult mucosal malignancy; usage of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Results: Overall, 60 patients (mean [SD] age, 55.5 [8.9] years) were identified; 48 of the 60 patients (80.0%) had a mucosal primary identified during their TORS-assisted endoscopic procedure. The mean (SD) size of the identified mucosal primary lesions was 1.3 (0.1) cm. All mucosal primaries, when found, originated in the oropharynx including the base of tongue in 28 patients (58%), palatine tonsil in 18 patients (38%), and glossotonsillar sulcus in 2 patients (4%). Among patients in this study, 40 (67%) did not receive chemotherapy, and 15 (25%) did not receive radiation therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: Advances in transoral surgical techniques have helped identify occult oropharyngeal malignancies that traditionally have been treated with comprehensive radiation to the entire pharyngeal axis. We demonstrate the efficacy of a TORS-assisted approach to identify and surgically treat the primary tumor in patients presenting with CUP. In addition, patients managed with the TORS-assisted endoscopic approach benefit from surgical and pathological triage, which in turn results in deintensification of treatment by eliminating the need for chemotherapy in the majority of patients, as well as avoiding radiation therapy in select patients.</text>

<text>Cantharidin Induced Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Apoptosis via the JNK-Regulated Mitochondria and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Related Signaling Pathways.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>159</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral cancer is a subtype of head and neck cancer which represents 2.65% of all human malignancies. Most of oral cancer is histopathologically diagnosed as oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). OSCC is characterized by a high degree of local invasion and a high rate of metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes. How to prevention and treatment of OSCC is important and imperative. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effect and molecular mechanism of cantharidin, an active compound isolated from blister beetles, on OSCC in vitro. Results showed that cantharidin significantly decreased cell viability in human tongue squamous carcinoma-derived SAS, CAL-27, and SCC-4 cell lines. The further mechanistic studies were carried out in SAS cells. Cantharidin also significantly increased apoptosis-related signals, including caspase-9, caspase-7 and caspase-3 proteins. Besides, cantharidin decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP) and induced cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) release. Cantharidin also increased Bax, Bid, and Bak protein expressions and decreased Bcl-2 protein expression. Cantharidin could also increase the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signals, including the expressions of phosphorylated eIF-2a and CHOP, but not Grp78 and Grp94. Furthermore, cantharidin reduced pro-caspase-12 protein expression. In signals of mitogen-activated protein kinases, cantharidin increased the phosphorylation of JNK, but not ERK and p38. Transfection of shRNA-JNK to OSCC cells effectively reversed the cantharidin-induced cell apoptotic signals, including the mitochondrial and ER stress-related signaling molecules. Taken together, these findings suggest that cantharidin induces apoptosis in OSCC cells via the JNK-regulated mitochondria and ER stress-related signaling pathways.</text>

<text>Risk of thyroid malignancy following an index head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A population-based study.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>110</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: To evaluate the incidence of a subsequent primary thyroid malignancy in patients with an index head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we analyzed the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify a cohort of patients who had been diagnosed with a primary HNSCC from 1973 through 2004. The study population was made up of 60,323 patients of all ages, roughly three-quarters of whom were male. A total of 60 patients (0.1%) developed a subsequent thyroid malignancy-not a statistically significant finding. The overall standard incidence ratio (SIR) for a subsequent thyroid malignancy was 1.58 (p &lt; 0.05). The highest SIRs were seen during in the first 5 years after diagnosis of the original primary (SIR: 3.05; p &lt; 0.05), more specifically in 2 to 11 months after diagnosis (SIR: 7.11; p &lt; 0.05). Further analyses demonstrated that SIRs were significantly higher in males (SIR: 1.71), in patients aged 60 through 79 years (SIR: 1.71), in whites (SIR: 1.55), in patients who had undergone external-beam radiotherapy for their index primary (SIR: 1.84), in those whose tumor was initially staged as regional (SIR: 1.96), and in patients whose index primary was in the oral cavity (SIR: 1.71) or larynx (SIR: 1.88) (p &lt; 0.05 for all). We conclude that the incidence of a subsequent primary thyroid malignancy in patients with an HNSCC is highest during the first 5 years after diagnosis of the index primary, reflecting the benefit of continued surveillance.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Metastasis is associated with poor prognosis in cancers. Exosomes, which are packed with RNA and proteins and are released in all biological fluids, are emerging as an important mediator of intercellular communication. However, the function of exosomes remains poorly understood in cancer metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that exosomes isolated by size-exclusion chromatography from a highly metastatic human oral cancer cell line, HOC313-LM, induced cell growth through the activation of ERK and AKT as well as promoted cell motility of the poorly metastatic cancer cell line HOC313-P. MicroRNA (miRNA) array analysis identified two oncogenic miRNAs, miR-342-3p and miR-1246, that were highly expressed in exosomes. These miRNAs were transferred to poorly metastatic cells by exosomes, which resulted in increased cell motility and invasive ability. Moreover, miR-1246 increased cell motility by directly targeting DENN/MADD Domain Containing 2D (DENND2D). Taken together, our findings support the metastatic role of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs, which highlights their potential for applications in miRNA-based therapeutics.</text>

<text>Tumour budding evaluated in biopsy specimens is a useful predictor of prognosis in patients with cN0 early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>142</offset>
<text>AIMS: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) prognosis depends on lymph node metastasis (LNM). We recently reported that tumour budding is a good predictive factor for LNM in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and floor of the mouth (FOM). Our aim was to evaluate whether tumour budding is a good prognostic factor in OSCC. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined conventional histopathological assessment and a new factor, tumour budding, in 209 cases of OSCC in incisional biopsy specimens. The relationship of tumour budding with LNM and prognosis was studied. The budding score was evaluated using immunostaining for pan-cytokeratin in all biopsies specimens; the number of budding foci was counted using a *20 objective lens. Significant factors using univariate analysis (P &lt; 0.05) in association with LNM were the budding score (intermediate or high score &gt;= 3; high score &gt;= 5), tumour grade (2 and 3), tumour depth (&gt;= 5 mm), infiltrative pattern (INF), lymphatic invasion and vessel invasion. In multivariate analysis, the budding score, INF and lymphatic invasion were found to be independent risk factors for LNM; in particular, budding score concerning relapse-free survival was statistically significant among patients with T1/2 stage and cN0 cancer using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of tumour budding is effective in predicting prognosis in cN0 early stage OSCC. In T1/2 stage and cN0 cancer, prophylactic neck dissection to prevent LNM should be considered when the tumour budding score regarding preoperative biopsy specimens is intermediate or high.

<offset>113</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Understanding the structure and function of the oropharynx is paramount to providing excellent patient care. In clinical oncology, the oropharynx is generally divided into four distinct components: (1) base of tongue, (2) soft palate, (3) palatine tonsillar fossa, and (4) pharyngeal wall. Oropharyngeal mucosa  is distinct from other mucosal surfaces in the body since it  is comprised of a reticulated epithelium  with a discontinuous basement membrane,  also known as  lymphoepithelium. This review article describes the anatomy, histology, immunology and surgical resection of the oropharynx as it relates to oncologic care. This article is protected by copyright.

<text>UNASSIGNED: "Warburg effect", the enhanced glycolysis or aerobic glycolysis, confers cancer cells the ability to survive and proliferate even under stressed conditions. In this study, we explored the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in orchestrating Warburg effect, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, and the acquisition of cancer stem-like cell properties in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Our results showed that EGF induces EMT process in OSCC cells, which correlates with the acquisition of cancer stem-like properties, including the enrichment of CD44+/CD24- population of cancer cells and an increased expression of CSC-related genes, aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) and Bmi-1. We also showed that EGF concomitantly enhanced L-lactate production, while blocking glycolysis by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) robustly reversed EGF-induced EMT process and CSC-like properties in OSCC cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that EGF promoted EMT process and CSC generation through EGFR/PI3K/HIF-1a axis-orchestrated glycolysis. Using an orthotopic tumor model of human OSCC (UM-SCC1) injected in the tongue of BALB/c nude mice, we showed that treatment with 2-DG in vivo significantly inhibited the metastasis of tumor cells to the regional cervical lymph nodes and reduced the expression of ALDH1 and vimentin in both in situ tumors and tumor cell-invaded regional lymph nodes. Taken together, these findings have unveiled a new mechanism that EGF drives OSCC metastasis through induction of EMT process and CSC generation, which is driven by an enhanced glycolytic metabolic program in OSCC cells.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The glycolytic enzyme hexokinase (HK2), which is aberrantly expressed in various types of tumours, is associated with metastasis. However, its role in the progression and metastasis of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remains unclear. The results of our study showed that HK2 expression is often deregulated in TSCC patients. Increased HK2 expression was associated with tumour stage, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, but not pathological grade, and reduced overall survival. Microarray and western blotting analyses revealed increases in HK2 expression in TSCC cells with higher metastatic potential. The following effects were observed with HK2 knockdown: inhibition of cell migration and invasion; reduced SOD2 activity and intracellular H2O2 levels; suppression of pERK1/2, Slug and Vimentin expression; and inhibition of tumour growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Conversely, HK2 overexpression promoted cell migration and invasion, increased SOD2 activity and intracellular H2O2, and enhanced expression of pERK1/2, Slug and Vimentin. Thus, our results demonstrate that deregulation of HK2 expression has an important function in the progression of TSCC and may serve as a biomarker of its metastatic potential in TSCC patients. HK2 enhances the metastatic potential of TSCC by stimulating the SOD2-H2O2 pathway.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: DNA repair systems play a critical role in protecting the human genome from damage caused by carcinogens. Modifications in DNA repair genes may be responsible for tumor development and resistance of malignant cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The major pathway for oxidative DNA damage repair is the base excision repair pathway. This study aimed to assess the immunoexpression of DNA repair proteins APE-1 and XRCC-1 and its association with clinical, histological and survival parameters in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma in order to investigate a possible role for those proteins in tumor behavior. METHODS: The expression of APE-1 and XRCC-1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 82 cases of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Histopathological grading was performed for each case. Pearson's Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to determine the association between protein expressions and clinicopathological features of tumors, whereas Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to analyze disease-specific and disease-free survival. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;= 0.05. RESULTS: APE-1 was highly expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm in 56% of cases, and XRCC-1 showed overexpression only in the nucleus in 60% of cases. High expression of XRCC-1 was significantly associated with tumors at early clinical stages (I and II, p&lt;0.01) and nodal status (p=0.03). Both proteins were not associated with other clinical parameters, histopathological grading or survival. CONCLUSIONS: DNA base excision repair proteins APE-1 and XRCC-1 are upregulated in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma, and XRCC-1 expression is associated with better clinical staging and nodal status.

<text>UNASSIGNED: Cetuximab is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody that binds competitively and with high affinity to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is used to treat advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. After receiving a total of six doses of cetuximab, a 72-year-old male presented with pretibial edema, acne-like skin rash, and nephrotic syndrome. The renal biopsy findings revealed features of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), with the expansion of the subendothelial zone, reduplication of the glomerular basement, and swelling of the endothelial cells. Nine weeks after the discontinuation of cetuximab, his pretibial edema had disappeared and proteinuria decreased. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which kidney biopsy revealed evidence of TMA due to cetuximab administration. Our report suggests that it may be prudent to monitor patients receiving cetuximab closely for the possible development of nephrotic syndrome.   .</text>

<text>Metaplastic squamous cell carcinoma of the breast: A case report and literature review.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>87</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Metaplastic tumors are rare and represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasms showing dominant areas of non-glandular differentiation. Etiology and pathogenesis of this type of lesion in the breast is uncertain. The most common sources of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the breast are lung, esophagus, cervix, and urinary bladder. Squamous cell carcinomas may present clinically with inflammation and average size greater than breast adenocarcinoma. As for imaging studies, mammography shows no typical findings and ultrasound can show a complicated cyst or an inflammatory process, among the differential diagnoses. Therefore, knowing this pathological entity, its clinical course and imaging findings is important to safely treat such a rare and aggressive disease. We herein report a case of metaplastic carcinoma, squamous subtype, diagnosed by core needle biopsy.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Non-CG methylation has been associated with stemness regulation in embryonic stem cells. By comparing differentially expressed genes affected by non-CG methylation between tumour and corresponding non-tumour tissues in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), we find that Integrin a7 (ITGA7) is characterized as a potential cancer stem cell (CSC) marker. Clinical data show that a high frequency of ITGA7(+) cells in OSCC tissues is significantly associated with poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and worse prognosis. Functional studies demonstrate that both sorted ITGA7(+) cells and ITGA7 overexpressing cells display enhanced stemness features, including elevated expression of stemness-associated genes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition features, as well as increased abilities to self-renew, differentiate and resist chemotherapy. Mechanistic studies find that ITGA7 regulates CSC properties through the activation of the FAK-mediated signalling pathways. As knockdown of ITGA7 can effectively reduce the stemness of OSCC cells, ITGA7 could be a potential therapeutic target in OSCC treatment.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: CHEK1 gene is known to play an important role in tumor progression by cell cycle control. However, the association between CHEK1 and the prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is unclear. In this study, we explored the association between genetic variants in CHEK1 gene and prognosis of ESCC patients treated with radical resection. A total of 131 thoracic ESCC patients who underwent radical resection were included in this retrospective study and genotyped using the MassArray method. According to the univariate Cox hazard analysis, the GT/TT genotype of CHEK1 rs555752 was shown to be strongly related to a decreased overall survival (OS) (HR=2.560, 95% CI: 1.415-4.631, P=0.002) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR=2.160, 95% CI: 1.258-3.710, P=0.005). Furthermore, according to the multivariate Cox hazard analysis and multiple testing, patients with the GT/TT genotype of CHEK1 rs555752 had a notably decreased OS (HR=2.735, 95% CI: 1.468-5.096, P=0.002, Pc=0.006) and DFS (HR=2.282, 95% CI: 1.292-4.023, P=0.004, Pc=0.012). In conclusion, genetic variants of the CHEK1 gene are significantly related to OS and DFS of ESCC patients, and may therefore be predictors of the prognosis of thoracic ESCC after surgery.</text>

<text>Computational analysis reveals microRNA-mRNA regulatory network in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>102</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. They are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. The aim of this study was to explore the microRNA-mRNA regulatory network in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) using comprehensive computational approaches. In this study we have selected a total of 11 miRNAs from one previously reported study in ESCC. The mRNA targets of these miRNAs were predicted using various algorithms. The expression profiles of these mRNA targets were identified on DNA microarray experiment dataset across ESCC tissue samples. Based on the miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships, the network was inferred. A total of 23 miRNA-mRNA regulatory interactions, with 11 miRNAs and 13 mRNA targets, were inferred in ESCC. The miRNA-mRNA regulatory network with increased confidence provides insights into the progression of ESCC and may serve as a biomarker for prognosis or the aggressiveness of ESCC. However, the results should be examined with further experimental validation.</text>

<text>Diagnostic Biomarkers in Oral Verrucous Carcinoma: A Systematic Review.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>71</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral verrucous carcinoma (OVC), a low-grade variant of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), is most frequently seen in the oral cavity. No clear etiology has been found for this lesion, but human papilloma virus, chewing betel nuts, and ultraviolet radiation are suggested as probable causes. Differential diagnosis of OVC is challenging for oral pathologists. The aim of this study was to review the molecular-based approaches for differential diagnosis of OVC. An electronic search was conducted in Medline and Scopus from January 2004 to July 2015 limited to English language publications. Published papers on verrucous carcinoma (VC) were found according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and analyzed qualitatively. Data extraction were performed according to PRISMA statement. A total of 423 articles were reviewed; out of which, 26 articles completely fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most of the included studies investigated proliferative and apoptotic biomarkers such as p53 and Ki67. No definite conclusion was drawn for cytoskeletal biomarkers due to variability of factors and lack of significant expression. However, it seems that cytokeratin10 (CK 10) can be useful for differentiation of OVC and benign squamous lesions. Among cell surface and extracellular matrix biomarkers tissue biomarkers, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -9, CD31 and CD68 seem to be useful for differentiation of OVC and OSCC and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) can help in differentiation of OVC from oral epithelial dysplasia. Differences among OVC, OSCC and normal epithelium in expression profiles of the investigated biomarkers help in their differential diagnosis; although, clinicohistopathological similarities among verrucous hyperplasia, noninvasive OVC and invasive well-differentiated OSCC make the diagnosis difficult. Further studies are required to better differentiate these oral lesions.</text>

<text>The effect of postoperative complications on survival of patients after minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>127</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has been shown to be a feasible technique for the treatment of esophageal cancer; however, its postoperative morbidity remains high. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the effect of postoperative complications on long-term outcomes in patients who have undergone MIE for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled patients who had undergone MIE for ESCC between September 2009 and November 2014; all procedures were performed by a single surgical team. Relevant patient characteristics and postoperative variables were collected and evaluated. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank tests. Possible predictors of survival were subjected to univariate analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. RESULTS: In all, data on 214 patients with ESCC were analyzed, including 170 men and 44 women. All study subjects had undergone thoracoscopic or thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy and cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. One hundred and thirty patients (60.7%) had postoperative complications (Grades 1-4). The overall DFS and DSS rates were 80.0 and 88.9% at 1  year, 48.6 and 54.2% at 3  years, and 43.2 and 43.5% at 5  years, respectively. Univariate analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that T stage, N stage, and tumor grade were independent prognostic factors for long-term survival; however, postoperative complications had no significant effect on the DFS or DSS of this patient cohort (log-rank test, p  =  0.354 and 0.160, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative complications have no significant effect on long-term survival in patients who have undergone MIE for ESCC.</text>

<text>Toward the use of precision medicine for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>

<offset>96</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Precision medicine is a new strategy that aims at preventing and treating human diseases by focusing on individual variations in people's genes, environment and lifestyle. Precision medicine has been used for cancer diagnosis and treatment and shows evident clinical efficacy. Rapid developments in molecular biology, genetics and sequencing technologies, as well as computational technology, has enabled the establishment of "big data", such as the Human Genome Project, which provides a basis for precision medicine. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive cancer with a high incidence rate and low survival rate. Current therapies are often aggressive and carry considerable side effects. Much research now indicates that precision medicine can be used for HNSCC and may achieve improved results. From this perspective, we present an overview of the current status, potential strategies, and challenges of precision medicine in HNSCC. We focus on targeted therapy based on cell the surface signaling receptors epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK/STAT3 and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cellular signaling pathways. Gene therapy for the treatment of HNSCC is also discussed.</text>

<text>Whole-Exome Sequencing Validates a Preclinical Mouse Model for the Prevention and Treatment of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>129</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC) are among the most common and highly mutated human malignancies. Solar UV radiation is the major factor in the etiology of cSCC. Whole-exome sequencing of 18 microdissected tumor samples (cases) derived from SKH-1 hairless mice that had been chronically exposed to solar-simulated UV (SSUV) radiation showed a median point mutation (SNP) rate of 155 per Mb. The majority (78.6%) of the SNPs are C.G&gt;T.A transitions, a characteristic UVR-induced mutational signature. Direct comparison with human cSCC cases showed high overlap in terms of both frequency and type of SNP mutations. Mutations in Trp53 were detected in 15 of 18 (83%) cases, with 20 of 21 SNP mutations located in the protein DNA-binding domain. Strikingly, multiple nonsynonymous SNP mutations in genes encoding Notch family members (Notch1-4) were present in 10 of 18 (55%) cases. The histopathologic spectrum of the mouse cSCC that develops in this model resembles very closely the spectrum of human cSCC. We conclude that the mouse SSUV cSCCs accurately represent the histopathologic and mutational spectra of the most prevalent tumor suppressors of human cSCC, validating the use of this preclinical model for the prevention and treatment of human cSCC.

<text>UNASSIGNED: Paraoxonase 3 (PON3) is an oncogene in cancer, however, little is known about the mechanisms and roles of PON3 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which is the aim of our study. We found that the expression of PON3 was up-regulated in OSCC samples and cell lines. PON3 was associated with accelerating cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion in OSCC cells. Further research showed that PON3 was regulated by PI3K/Akt pathway. We also found that AP-1 was an important transcriptional factor regulating PON3 expression in OSCC. The study elucidates that PI3K/Akt pathway up-regulated the expression of PON3 in OSCC by AP-1.</text>

<text>A Gingiva-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Laden Porcine Small Intestinal Submucosa Extracellular Matrix Construct Promotes Myomucosal Regeneration of the Tongue.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>159</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: In the oral cavity, the tongue is the anatomic subsite most commonly involved by invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Current treatment protocols often require significant tissue resection to achieve adequate negative margins and optimal local tumor control. Reconstruction of the tongue while preserving and/or restoring its critical vocal, chewing, and swallowing functions remains one of the major challenges in head and neck oncologic surgery. We investigated the in vitro feasibility of fabricating a novel combinatorial construct using porcine small intestinal submucosa extracellular matrix (SIS-ECM) and human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) as a GMSC/SIS-ECM tissue graft for the tongue reconstruction. We developed a rat model of critical-sized myomucosal defect of the tongue that allowed the testing of therapeutic effects of an acellular SIS-ECM construct versus a GMSC/SIS-ECM construct on repair and regeneration of the tongue defect. We showed that the GMSC/SIS-ECM construct engrafted at the host recipient site, promoted soft tissue healing, and regenerated the muscular layer, as compared to the SIS-ECM alone or non-treated defect controls. Furthermore, our results revealed that transplantation of the GMSC/SIS-ECM construct significantly increased the expression of several myogenic transcriptional factors and simultaneously suppressed the expression of type I collagen at the wounded area of the tongue. These compelling findings suggest that, unlike the tongue contracture and fibrosis of the non-treated defect group, transplantation of the combinatorial GMSC/SIS-ECM constructs accelerates wound healing and muscle regeneration, and maintains the overall tongue shape, possibly by both enhancing the function of endogenous skeletal progenitor cells and suppressing fibrosis. Together, our findings indicate that GMSC/SIS-ECM potentially served as a myomucosal graft for tongue reconstruction post-surgery of head and neck cancer.</text>

<text>Variations in Treatment of Cervical Cancer According to Tumor Morphology-Population-Based Cohort Analysis of English National Cancer Registration Data.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>151</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate differences in the treatment of cervical cancer by tumor morphology after accounting for demographic, diagnostic, and tumor factors. METHODS: Retrospective population-based observational study using linked cancer registration and treatment data from administrative data sources of women diagnosed with cervical cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition C53, malignant behavior) during 2009 and 2010 in England. Descriptive analyses and multinomial regression modeling have been used to consider differences in treatment by morphological subtype. For each morphological subtype, number and percentage of cases are presented by demographic, diagnostic, and tumor factors and treatment modality. Relative risk ratios are provided for each treatment modality by morphological subtype and other specified factors. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of women were treated surgically; 36% by clinical oncology and only 8% by combination of surgery and clinical oncology. Compared with squamous cell carcinomas, both adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas were more likely to be treated by trachelectomy, hysterectomy, radiotherapy with hysterectomy, or chemoradiotherapy with hysterectomy than by chemoradiotherapy without hysterectomy. These differences were explained mainly by a different stage distribution, but some difference remained after adjustment for other factors including stage. As clinically recommended, neuroendocrine tumors were not treated surgically. Further treatment differences were found by age, route to diagnosis, stage, and grade. Deprivation was not generally associated with treatment differences, with 1 exception that those from more deprived areas were less likely to be treated by trachelectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Important treatment differences according to tumor morphology remain after adjusting for relevant patient demographic, diagnostic, and tumor factors. In particular, the difference between the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma is notable.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Galectin-3 has been suggested relative to tumor genesis, progression, and metastasis in basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma that are the most common skin cancers characterized by malignant epidermal proliferation. In this study, we evaluated galectin-3 expression in seborrheic keratosis, keratoacanthoma, and infectious diseases including verruca vulgaris, condyloma acuminatum, and chromoblastomycosis that are pathologically featured by benign epidermal proliferation. Galectin-3 expression was shown by immunohistochemical staining and quantified using the Image Pro Plus V6.0. We found that galectin-3 distributed evenly in normal skin around the body decreased significantly in all selected diseases compared with healthy controls, but it was comparable among each disease. These findings imply that galectin-3 do not differentiate between benign and malignant proliferation of keratinocytes.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Blockade of the programmed-death 1 receptor (PD-1)/programmed-death ligand (PD-L1) pathway efficiently reduces tumour growth and improves survival. Durable tumour regression with blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint has been demonstrated in recent clinical studies. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is highly immunosuppressive, and PD-L1 expression has been proposed as a potential mechanism responsible for this phenotype. Despite the fact that anti-PD-1 treatment can produce durable responses, such therapy appears to benefit only a subset of patients. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying regulation of PD-L1 expression in the OSCC microenvironment. In this study, we showed that PD-L1 expression in high-grade invasive OSCC cell lines was lower than that in a low-grade invasive OSCC line and found a close correlation between PD-L1 expression and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). PD-L1 expression was upregulated in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in high-grade invasive human OSCC tissues or co-cultured with mesenchymal-phenotype OSCC cells in vitro. TLR4-inhibitory peptide successfully suppressed PD-L1 upregulation on macrophages and DCs co-cultured with mesenchymal-phenotype OSCC cells, suggesting that some EMT-induced tumour antigen is critical for PD-L1 induction on tumour-associated macrophages and DCs. Further studies are necessary to explore the impact of EMT on the tumour immune microenvironment and to identify potential biomarkers for selecting patients who might preferentially benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or immunotherapies more broadly.</text>

<text>Down syndrome critical region 1 positively correlates with angiogenesis in hypopharyngeal cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>97</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Hypopharyngeal carcinoma has one of the highest mortality rates of head and neck cancer, therefore, the identification of markers associated with the pathogenesis and development of hypopharyngeal cancer is critical. Down syndrome critical region 1 (DSCR1) is associated with carcinogenesis and tumor growth in several types of malignancy. Activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway upregulates DSCR1. The aims of the present study were to determine the expression levels of DSCR1 and VEGF  -C in hypopharyngeal cancer, and investigate the association between DSCR1 and angiogenesis in the disease. Tissue samples from 94  cases of pathologically confirmed hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma were collected. The mRNA levels of DSCR1 and VEGF  -C in cancerous and paracancerous tissues were examined using semi  -quantitative reverse transcription  -polymerase chain reaction. Microvessel density (MVD) was counted, according to the number of cluster of differentiation  34  -positive cells. Spearman's correlation analysis was utilized to analyze the association between DSCR1 and angiogenesis. The relative mRNA expression levels of DSCR1 and VEGF  -C, and the MVD were significantly increased in the cancerous tissue samples from the patients with hypopharyngeal cancer, compared with the paracancerous tissue samples from these patients. Higher levels of DSCR1 and increased MVD were associated with poorly differentiated tumors and lymph node metastasis. The mRNA expression levels of DSCR1 were positively correlated with the mRNA levels of VEGF  -C in the cancerous tissues. The protein expression levels of DSCR1 were also positively correlated with MVD in the cancerous tissues. The results indicated that DSCR1 is involved in tumor angiogenesis in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer, and is closely associated with the progression of the disease.</text>

<text>Squamous Cell Carcinoma in African Children with Xeroderma Pigmentosum: Three Case Reports.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>91</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease. This disease predisposes patients to early-onset skin cancers, particularly squamous cell carcinoma. Here, we report 3 pediatric cases, including 2 deaths. OBSERVATION: The subjects included 2 boys and 1 girl with skin type VI. All subjects were from consanguineous marriages, and the average age was 7.6 years. The patients all had ulcerative budding tumor lesions in the cephalic region, and the mean disease duration was 18 months. In all 3 cases, the diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum was made before the poikilodermal appearance of sun-exposed areas and photophobia. Neurological-type mental retardation was noted in 1 case. Histology confirmed squamous cell carcinoma in all 3 cases. The evolutions were marked by the death of 2 children (cases 1 and 3). In one case, the outcome was favorable following cancer excision and subsequent chemotherapy with adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Squamous cell carcinoma is a serious complication related to xeroderma pigmentosum in Sub-Saharan Africa. Prevention is based on the early diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum, black skin photoprotection, screening and early treatment of lesions, and genetic counseling.</text>

<text>The prognostic value of systemic and local inflammation in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>107</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Cancer-related systemic inflammation has been demonstrated to be associated with poor outcome in multiple types of cancers. Meanwhile, the local inflammation, which is characterized by dense intratumoral immune infiltrate, is a favorable predictor of survival outcome. PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of systemic and local inflammation in predicting outcome in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 120 patients who had undergone postoperative radiotherapy were enrolled. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), as calculated from pretreatment whole blood counts, were used to indicate systemic inflammation. The optimal cutoff values of NLR and PLR were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) density, as assessed by pathologist review of hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, was used to represent local inflammation. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The best cutoff was 2.79 for NLR and 112 for PLR. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high NLR, high PLR, and low TILs density were significantly correlated with inferior OS and RFS, respectively (all P&lt;0.05). The Cox proportional multivariate hazard model showed that a high pretreatment PLR and a low TILs density were both independently correlated with poor OS and RFS, respectively (all P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Markers of systemic and local inflammation, especially PLR and TILs density, are reliable prognostic factors in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>

<text>Decreased Skeletal Muscle Mass After Neoadjuvant Therapy Correlates with Poor Prognosis in Patients with Esophageal Cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>123</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Loss of skeletal muscle is predictive of a poor prognosis in patients with various malignant lesions. Our aim was to determine whether changes in skeletal muscle after neo-adjuvant therapy (NAT) predict prognosis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) undergoing esophagectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cross-sectional areas of the psoas muscles were measured on computed tomographic images collected at the initial visit, preoperatively and postoperatively in 84 patients. The psoas muscle index (PMI) was calculated by normalizing the cross-sectional areas to the patients' heights. RESULTS: Low PMI at the initial visit was not associated with a poor prognosis. The majority of patients showed decreased PMI after NAT and surgery. The group in which the post-NAT PMI decreased had poorer overall survival than group without PMI decrease (p=0.025). CONCLUSION: Decreased PMI correlates well with a poor prognosis in patients with ESCC. Changes in PMI over a period of time may have greater sensitivity when evaluating prognosis than the PMI at any single time point.</text>

<text>Impact of Induction Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced HPV-negative Oropharyngeal Cancer. A Propensity Score-matched analysis.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>124</offset>
<text>AIM: To estimate the clinical outcomes of induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by standard chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and CRT alone in patients with locally advanced human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with histologically-proven HPV-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx were included and treated with IC-CRT or CRT alone. In order to compare treatment outcomes and toxicity between groups, patients were matched by primary tumor site and clinical disease stage. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Nine IC patients and 18 CRT patients were included. All patients completed the programmed treatment. The median follow-up was 38 months. There were no statistically significant differences in OS and DFS between groups. The 5-year MFS was 88.9% and 50.8% in the IC-CRT group, respectively. There was no meaningful difference in toxicity between patients. CONCLUSION: In HPV-negative patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer, adding IC to standard CRT may increase the MFS rate. However no significant differences in OS and DFS were observed. More studies are needed to better elucidate the role of IC in this setting.</text>

<text>Laryngo-esophageal Dysfunction-free Survival in a Preservation Protocol for T3 Laryngeal Squamous-cell Carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>113</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: We reviewed the outcomes of patients with T3 laryngeal neoplasms with a fixed hemilarynx, a large gross tumor volume or a subglottic extension (SGE), treated with a laryngeal-preservation protocol with induction chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study end-points were laryngo-esophageal dysfunction-free survival (LEDFS), laryngectomy-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were included. The 2-year and 5-year OS rates were 70.4% and 54.5%, respectively. OS and DFS were independent of the treatment modality in the whole cohort (p=0.6546 and p=0.3006, respectively) and in patients with SGE (p=0.529 and p=0.255, respectively). The 2-year and 5-year LEDFS rates were 44.3% and 28.2%, respectively. LEDFS was not associated with initial hemilaryngeal fixation or SGE (p=0.5772 and p=0.0623, respectively). CONCLUSION: Chemoselection is feasible without compromised oncological or functional outcomes in patients with an initially fixed hemilarynx or subglottic extension.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: PDZ-binding kinase/T-cell-originated protein kinase (PBK/TOPK) is a serine-threonine kinase and overexpressed in various types of cancer. PBK/TOPK is associated with tumor cell development and progression through suppression of p53 function. In this study, we tested whether PBK acts as a cancer-promoting factor by being overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed PBK/TOPK expression in 15 ESCC cell lines, and 54 primary ESCC tumors that were curatively resected between 1994 and 2007. RESULTS: Overexpression of the PBK/TOPK protein was detected in 93% (14/15) ESCC cell lines and 19% (10/54) primary ESCC tumor samples, and significantly correlated with macroscopic appearance and tumor depth. PBK/TOPK positivity was independently associated with worse outcome in multivariate analysis (p=0.0235, hazard ratio=3.58). Knockdown of PBK/TOPK using specific siRNAs inhibited the cell proliferation, invasion/migration of PBK/TOPK-overexpressing ESCC cell lines. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PBK/TOPK plays a crucial role in tumor malignant potential through its overexpression in ESCC.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Tachykinin 3 (TAC3) and its preferred tachykinin receptor 3 (TACR3) that are prominently detected in the central nervous system, play significant roles in physiological development and specifically in the human reproductive system. The roles of TAC3/TACR3 in oral squamous cell carcinoma are unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the expression pattern of TAC3/TACR3 in clinically-resected oral squamous cell carcinoma samples using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis. RESULTS: We found that even though the expression level of TACR3 was negative in the normal epithelium, it was highly elevated in tumor cells. A more intense signal was observed in the invasive front of tumor cells that had migrated into the mandible bone matrix. TAC3 was not detected in tumor cells, but was expressed in PGP-9.5-positive sensory nerves in the mandible. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that peripheral sensory nerve-derived TAC3 may affect gingival oral squamous cell carcinoma cells through TACR3 in the bone matrix.</text>

<text>Molecular Factors Associated with Pemetrexed Sensitivity According to Histological Type in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>118</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate potential molecules that predict chemosensitivity to pemetrexed (Alimta  ) in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemosensitivity to ALM and other drugs was assessed by succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (SDI) test in 69 NSCLC samples (55 adenocarcinomas, and 14 squamous cell carcinomas). The mRNA expression levels of Alimta  -target enzymes [thymidylate synthase (TYMS); dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT)], Alimta  -metabolizing enzymes [y-glutamyl hydrase (GGH) and folylpolyglutamate synthase] and an Alimta   transporter [reduce folate carrier (RFC)] were measured and examined for potential correlations to chemosensitivity. RESULTS: The squamous cell carcinoma samples showed higher TYMS expression and lower RFC expression than did the adenocarcinoma samples. In the adenocarcinoma sample analyses, GGH expression was inversely correlated to sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The histology-dependent differences in chemosensitivity to Alimta   may be attributed to the histology-dependent differences in TYMS and RFC expression. In adenocarcinomas, GGH potentially represents a marker for chemosensitivity to Alimta  .</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral cancer is aggressive and invasive. The 5-year survival rate is around 50% and has not improved in over 50 years. One-third of oral cancer patients develop local and/or regional tumor recurrence following treatment. We continue to use our multicellular spheroid (MCS) model to better understand how the extracellular matrix contributes to epithelial to mesenchymal transition and how hypoxia contributes to the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).</text>

<text>BACKGROUND/AIM: Ectopic myoglobin (MB) expression, mediated by alternative and hypoxia-inducible transcription, has recently been demonstrated in several epithelial tumours. This study aimed to examine the expression of MB in hormone-independent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using imunohistochemistry, ectopic MB expression was analyzed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) of 524 patients with localized and locally advanced primary and recurrent HNSCC who had undergone surgical treatment with curative intent. Associations of MB expression with survival and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: MB expression was found in 45.8% of HNSCC patients being significantly lower in normal adjacent tissue (NAT) compared to primary and recurrent tumours (p&lt;0.001) and significantly associated with a favourable overall survival (OS) in HNSCC [p=0.037, hazard ratio (HR)=0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.53-0.98]. Furthermore, MB expression negatively correlated with human papillomavirus (HPV) status (p=0.013). CONCLUSION: MB is differentially expressed in HNSCC and correlates with a better OS.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: The functional properties of actin-regulating formin proteins are diverse and in many cases cell-type specific. FHOD1, a formin expressed predominantly in cells of mesenchymal lineage, bundles actin filaments and participates in maintenance of cell shape, migration and cellular protrusions. FHOD1 participates in cancer-associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in oral squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer. The role of FHOD1 in melanomas has not been characterized. Here, we show that FHOD1 expression is typically strong in cutaneous melanomas and cultured melanoma cells while the expression is low or absent in benign nevi. By using shRNA to knockdown FHOD1 in melanoma cells, we discovered that FHOD1 depleted cells are larger, rounder and have smaller focal adhesions and inferior migratory capacity as compared to control cells. Importantly, we found FHOD1 depleted cells to have reduced colony-forming capacity and attenuated tumor growth in vivo, a finding best explained by the reduced proliferation rate caused by cell cycle arrest. Unexpectedly, FHOD1 depletion did not prevent invasive growth at the tumor margins. These results suggest that FHOD1 participates in key cellular processes that are dysregulated in malignancy, but may not be essential for melanoma cell invasion.</text>

<text>Squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior tongue: is tumour thickness an indicator for cervical metastasis?</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>105</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue accounts for 90% of all malignancies affecting the oral cavity and oropharynx. The distribution between the anterior and posterior tongue is equal. Nodal metastasis is dependent on various factors including tumour thickness, site, size, differentiation, and perineural and perivascular invasion. There is increasing evidence of a close correlation between tumour thickness and metastasis. A retrospective study covering the 16-year period from 2000 to 2016 was performed. Eighty-one patients with anterior tongue SCC were included. The only primary treatment was surgery. All patients were T1/T2N0M0 stage. Sixty-five patients underwent local excision with simultaneous selective neck dissection; 29 of these patients were confirmed to have occult metastasis. Sixteen patients underwent local excision only as an initial treatment. Four of them subsequently developed neck metastasis within a 6- to 18-month period. The results of this study support recent publications associating tumour thickness with nodal disease. Therefore, it is postulated that prophylactic neck dissection should be considered when the tumour thickness of anterior tongue SCC exceeds 5mm, in order to prevent lymphatic spread and improve the survival rate.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: In search for soluble derivatives of PAMAM dendrimers as potential carriers for hydrophobic drugs, the conjugates of PAMAM G3 with biotin, further converted into glycodendrimer with d-glucoheptono-1,4-lactone, were prepared. Polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM) of third generation, G3 was functionalized with four biotin equivalents covalently attached to terminal amine nitrogens via amide bond G3(4B). The remaining 28 amine groups were blocked by glucoheptoamide substituents (gh) to give G3(4B28gh) or with one fluorescein equivalent (attached by reaction of G3(4B) with fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC) via thiourea bond as FITC followed by exhaustive glucoheptoamidation to get G3(4B27gh1F). As a control the G3 substituted totally with 32 glucoheptoamide residues, G3(gh) and its fluorescein labeled analogue G3(31gh1F) were synthesized. The glucoheptoamidation of PAMAM G0 dendrimer with glucoheptono-1,4-lactone was performed in order to fully characterize the (1)H NMR spectra of glucoheptoamidated PAMAM dendrimers and to control the derivatization of G3 with glucoheptono-1,4-lactone. Another two derivatives of G3, namely G3(4B28gh1F') and G3(32ghF'), with ester bonded fluorescein were also obtained. Biological properties of obtained dendrimer conjugates were estimated in vitro with human cell lines: normal fibroblast (BJ) and two cancer glioblastoma (U-118 MG) and squamous carcinoma (SCC-15), including cytotoxicity by reduction of XTT and neutral red (NR) assays. Cellular uptake of dendrimer conjugates was evaluated with confocal microscopy. Obtained results confirmed, that biotinylated bioconjugates have always lower cytotoxicity and 3-4 times higher cellular uptake than non-biotinylated dendrimer conjugates in all cell lines. Comparison of various cell lines revealed different dose-dependent cell responses and the lower cytotoxicity of examined dendrimer conjugates for normal fibroblasts and squamous carcinoma, as compared with much higher cytotoxic effects seen in glioblastoma cell line. Synthetized multi-functional conjugate (G3(4B27gh1F)) is a promising candidate as biocompatible vehicle for hydrophobic molecules used in anticancer therapy.</text>

<text>Human epidermal stem cells: Role in adverse skin reactions and carcinogenesis from radiation.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>93</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: In human skin, keratinopoiesis is based on a functional hierarchy among keratinocytes, with rare slow-cycling stem cells responsible for the long-term maintenance of the tissue through their self-renewal potential, and more differentiated daughter progenitor cells actively cycling to permit epidermal renewal and turn-over every month. Skin is a radio-responsive tissue, developing all types of radiation damage and pathologies, including early tissue reactions such as dysplasia and denudation in epidermis, and later fibrosis in the dermis and acanthosis in epidermis, with the TGF-beta 1 pathway as a known master switch. Also there is a risk of basal cell carcinoma, which arises from epidermal keratinocytes, notably after oncogenic events in PTCH1 or TP53 genes. This review will cover the mechanisms of adverse human skin reactions and carcinogenesis after various types of exposures to ionizing radiation, with comparison with animal data when necessary, and will discuss the possible role of stem cells and their progeny in the development of these disorders. The main endpoints presented are basal cell intrinsic radiosensitivity, genomic stability, individual factors of risk, dose specific responses, major molecular pathways involved and the cellular origin of skin reactions and cancer. Although major advances have been obtained in recent years, the precise implications of epidermal stem cells and their progeny in these processes are not yet fully characterized.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is among the most common squamous cell carcinoma in South China and Southeast Asia. Radiotherapy is the primary treatment for NPC. However, radioresistance acts as a significant factor that limits the efficacy of radiotherapy for NPC patients. Growing evidence supports that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in radiation response. METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was used to analyze the expression of miR-19b-3p in NPC cell lines and NP69. miR-19b-3p expression profiles in NPC tissues were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The effect of miR-19b-3p on radiosensitivity was evaluated by cell viability assays, colony formation assays and in vivo experiment. Apoptosis and cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry. Luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the target genes of miR-19b-3p. Expression of target proteins and downstream molecules were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: miR-19b-3p was upregulated in NPC and served as an independent predictor for reduced patient survival. Radioresponse assays showed that miR-19b-3p overexpression resulted in decreased sensitivity to irradiation, whereas miR-19b-3p downregulation resulted in increased sensitivity to irradiation in vitro. Moreover, miR-19b-3p decreased the sensitivity of NPC cells to irradiation in vivo. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that TNFAIP3 was a direct target gene of miR-19b-3p. Knockdown of TNFAIP3 reduced sensitivity to irradiation, whereas upregulation of TNFAIP3 expression reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-19b-3p on NPC cell radiosensitivity. Mechanistically, we found that miR-19b-3p increased NPC cell radioresistance by activating the TNFAIP3/ NF-kB axis. CONCLUSIONS: miR-19b-3p contributes to the radioresistance of NPC by activating the TNFAIP3/ NF-kB axis. miR-19b-3p is a determinant of NPC radioresponse and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in NPC treatment.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: A 70-year-old man was referred to our department for further examination and treatment of a painless penile mass of about 2cm. The patient first noticed the mass onlya few weeks before presentation. Diagnostic biopsy was interpreted as leiomyosarcoma. Through systemic examinations the clinical stage of his disease was diagnosed as cT2N0M0 and we performed total penectomy. Histopathological examination for the totallyresected tissue disclosed the concomitant presence of regions compatible to squamous cell carcinoma and the results of immunohistochemistrywere compatible with the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, sarcomatoid subtype of the penis. One month after the surgery, multiple metastases to left inguinal lymph nodes and lungs developed, for which systemic chemotherapy by doxorubicin was ineffective and the patient died of respiratoryinsufficiencyfive months after presentation.</text>

<text>Importance: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has a favorable prognosis, and p16 immunohistochemistry is a surrogate marker of high-risk HPV infection and strong prognosticator. Given this favorable prognosis, treatment de-escalation for p16-positive OPSCC is now being considered with the goal of decreasing treatment-associated morbidity without compromising tumor control. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting is becoming increasingly unclear. Objective: To compare survival between surgically managed patients with p16-positive OPSCC who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy alone. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a cohort study of patients with OPSCC diagnosed from June 1996 to June 2010, with follow-up through December 2014, at a single tertiary referral center. One hundred ninety-five surgically managed, p16-positive patients without a history of head and neck cancer or distant metastasis at time of diagnosis were included. Exposures: Patients were dichotomized into adjuvant radiotherapy and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy groups. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival was the primary outcome, and disease-free survival was the secondary outcome. Propensity-weighted multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted to quantify the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival. Results: The study included 195 patients with p16-positive, surgically managed OPSCC. Median duration of follow-up was 87 months (interquartile range, 68-116 months). Ninety patients received adjunct chemoradiotherapy (mean age, 54.3 years), 88 patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (mean age, 56.4 years), and 17 patients received surgery alone. The 5-year overall survival rate for patients who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was 82% (95% CI, 73%-90%) and 84% (95% CI, 76%-91%) for patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy alone. The 5-year disease-free survival rate for patients who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was 79% (95% CI, 71%-88%) and 79% (95% CI, 70%-88%) for patients who received radiotherapy alone. After weighting cases by the inverse probability of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and controlling for age, comorbidity, smoking, pathological T stage, and pathological N stage, the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy was not significantly associated with disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.59-1.42) but was associated with a statistically insignificant yet clinically meaningful increase in all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.91-2.33). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with p16-positive OPSCC managed surgically with adjuvant radiotherapy, the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy provided no additional disease-free survival benefit and was associated with worse overall survival. These results should help inform future clinical trials aiming to deescalate treatment for p16-positive patients.</text>

<text>Impact of Sonic Hedgehog Pathway Expression on Outcome in HPV Negative Head and Neck Carcinoma Patients after Surgery and Adjuvant Radiotherapy.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>144</offset>
<text>INTRODUCTION: HPV positive patients suffering from head and neck cancer benefit from intensified radiotherapy when applied as a primary as well as an adjuvant treatment strategy. However, HPV negative patients treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy lack validated prognostic biomarkers. It is therefore important to define prognostic biomarkers in this particular patient population. Especially,   high-risk groups   need to be defined in order to adapt treatment protocols. Since dysregulation of the sonic hedgehog pathway plays an important role in carcinogenesis, we aimed to assess whether members of the sonic hedgehog-signaling pathway may act as prognostic factors in patients with HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, pretreatment tumor biopsies of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were taken during panendoscopy (2005 to 2008). All patients were treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. After assessment of HPV and p16 status, protein expression profiles of the Sonic hedgehog-signaling pathway were determined by immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray analyses in 36 HPV negative tumor biopsies. Expression profiles of Sonic hedgehog, Indian hedgehog, Patched, Smoothened, Gli-1, Gli-2 and Gli-3 were correlated with patients   clinical data, local-control rate, disease-free as well as overall survival. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas databank were used for external validation of our results. RESULTS: Gli-1 (p = 0.04) and Gli-2 (p = 0.02) overexpression was significantly linked to improved overall survival of HPV negative patients. Gli-2 (p = 0.04) overexpression correlated significantly with prolonged disease-free survival. Cox-multivariate analysis showed that overexpression of Gli-2 correlated independently (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.16-0.95, p = 0.03) with increased overall survival. DISCUSSION: Gli-1 and Gli-2 overexpression represents a substantial prognostic factor for overall and disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced HPV negative head and neck cancer undergoing surgery and postoperative radiotherapy.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: S100P is known to affect tumor development and metastasis of various cancers, but its role in endometrial cancer is unclear. We reported that S100P expression was dramatically elevated in both endometrial squamous cell carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma, but not in adenocarcinoma and normal endometrial samples. Moreover, we revealed an oncogenic role of S100P promoting cell proliferation, invasion, and migration while reducing apoptosis, possibly via its upregulation and/or activation of receptors of advanced glycation end products and consequently the oncogenic PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways. Therefore, S100P might be a specific biomarker and a potential drug target for squamous cell and adenosquamous carcinoma subtypes of endometrial cancer.</text>

This paper reports a pilot study to validate a previously published risk adjustment score on patients from separate UK cancer centres. METHODS A case note audit was performed of 1,075 patients undergoing 1,218 operations for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma under general anaesthesia in 4 surgical centres. A logistic regression equation predicting for all complications, previously validated internally at sites  A-C, was tested on a fourth external validation sample (site  D, 172 operations) using receiver operating characteristic curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit analysis and Brier scores. RESULTS Thirty-day complication rates varied widely (34-51%) between the centres. The predictive score allowed imperfect risk adjustment (area under the curve: 0.70), with Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis suggesting good calibration. The Brier score changed from 0.19 for sites  A-C to 0.23 when site  D was also included, suggesting poor accuracy overall. CONCLUSIONS Marked differences in operative risk and patient case mix captured by the risk adjustment score do not explain all the differences in observed outcomes. Further investigation with different methods is recommended to improve modelling of risk. Morbidity is common, and usually has a major impact on patient recovery, ward occupancy, hospital finances and patient perception of quality of care. We hope comparative audit will highlight good performance and challenge underperformance where it exists.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: MutT homolog-1 (MTH1) is a pyrophosphatase that acts on oxidized nucleotides and hydrolyzes 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine triphosphate in deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool to prevent its incorporation into nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, result in reduce cytotoxicity in tumor cells. MTH1 is overexpressed in various cancers and is considered as a therapeutic target. Environmental factors such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are critical risk factors for the development and progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), suggesting that oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of ESCC. We examined the expression of MTH1 and the accumulation of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in 84 patients with ESCC who underwent curative resection without neoadjuvant therapy. MTH1 mRNA level was quantified by performing quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded cancer tissues was performed to determine MTH1 protein expression and 8-oxo-dG accumulation. MTH1 mRNA expression was higher in cancerous tissues than in the corresponding normal epithelium (P  &lt;  0.0001). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that high MTH1 expression was significantly associated with deeper tumor invasion and venous invasion, advanced cancer stage, and poor overall survival (P  =  0.0021) and disease-specific survival (P  =  0.0013) compared with low MTH1 expression. Furthermore, high MTH1 expression was an independent predictor of poor disease-specific survival (P  =  0.0121). In contrast, 8-oxo-dG accumulation was not associated with any clinicopathological factor and poor prognosis. These results suggest that MTH1 overexpression is a predictor of ESCC progression and poor prognosis and that MTH1 can serve as a therapeutic target for treating patients with ESCC.</text>

<text>A case report of adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the duodenal papilla.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>70</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Adenosquamous carcinoma of the duodenal papilla is rare. A 73-year-old man was referred to the Saiseikai-Matsusaka General Hospital with upper abdominal pain and liver dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) revealed dilatation of the common bile duct (CBD) and intrahepatic bile duct along with a tumor in the distal CBD. The tumor showed enhancement in the arterial phase on contrast-enhanced CT. We performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and noted a red, erosive, bleeding mass in the duodenal papilla with obstruction of the distal CBD, and dilatation of the CBD. Histopathological inspection of a biopsy of the duodenal papilla showed a mixture of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting the presence of adenosquamous cell carcinoma in the duodenal papilla. Abdominal examinations including positron emission tomography/CT showed no metastasis or lymph node swelling. The clinical stage was determined to be cT2N0M0 Stage IB. We performed subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Histopathological inspection of the specimen showed a mixture of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 40% of the tumor. The tumor was defined as pathological Stage IIA, AcbBd, mixed type, med, pT3b, sci, INFb, ly2, v1, ne2, pN1, HM0, PM0, EM0, PV0, A0, R0, pT3N0M0. We suggested adjuvant chemotherapy, but the patient declined adjuvant chemotherapy and wished to be discharged. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed multiple liver metastases 3 months postoperatively. The patient opted for best supportive care and died 9 months postoperatively. Examination of 23 reports of adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the duodenal papilla in Japan suggested that adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the duodenal papilla has a poorer prognosis compared with adenocarcinoma of the duodenal papilla. Some reports have stated that the growth rate is faster for squamous cell carcinoma than for adenocarcinoma. In our case, the tumor was enhanced in the arterial phase and this represents a feature of adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the duodenal papilla. Chemotherapy has not been established for adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the duodenal papilla. We are confident that we can establish effective chemotherapies in the future.</text>

<text>Primary paranasal sinus clear cell carcinoma with EWSR1-ATF1 fusion: report of two molecularly confirmed cases exhibiting unique histopathology.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>144</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma (HCCC) is a rare low-grade tumor of the salivary glands made up of clear cells that form cords and nests in hyalinized stroma. To date, primary HCCCs of the paranasal sinus have not been described. This article presents two cases of HCCC of the maxillary sinus with unusual glandular formation and lymphoplasmacytic stroma in Case 1 and a characteristic solid nest pattern and fibrocellular and hyalinized stroma in Case 2. Immunohistochemical studies excluded myoepithelial origin and sinonasal renal cell-like adenocarcinomas. Negativity for p63 and p40 in Case 1 ruled out a squamous cell origin. Both cases showed a rearranged EWSR1 gene. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction detected EWSR1-ATF1 fusion gene transcripts, and Sanger sequencing confirmed an EWSR1 exon 11 fused in-frame to ATF exon 3.</text>

<text>PURPOSE: To examine oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) specimens for programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and presence of programmed death-1 (PD-1)-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and to determine possible clinicopathologic implications. It was hypothesized that PD-L1 expression and PD-1-positive TIL presence in OSCC would have no clinical relevance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors implemented a retrospective cohort study design. The study cohort was chosen in compliance with predefined inclusion criteria. Demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data were gathered. Tissue microarrays were obtained from paraffin-embedded OSCC specimens and analyzed immunohistochemically for PD-L1 expression and PD-1-positive TIL infiltration. PD-L1 positivity of OSCC specimens served as the predictor variable and neck node metastasis served as the primary outcome variable. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed and the significance level was set at a P value less than or equal to .05. RESULTS: The study sample was composed of 88 patients (48 men, 40 women; mean age, 61.34  yr). Marked PD-L1 expression was detected in 29% of OSCC specimens (26 of 88) and 83% of specimens (73 of 88) exhibited a high rate of PD-1-positive TIL infiltration. PD-L1 positivity of OSCC samples was significantly associated with the anatomic origin of OSCC (P  = .039), presence of cervical metastasis (P  = .039), and high PD-L1-positive TIL infiltration (P  = .033). CONCLUSION: A considerable proportion of OSCCs exhibited marked PD-L1 expression. This could be associated with clinical parameters. PD-L1 expression in OSCC might differ depending on its anatomic origin. PD-1-positive TILs could be detected in most OSCC specimens. These findings might indicate a potential role for the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathway in OSCC.</text>

<text>Neck dissection versus "watchful-waiting" in early squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue our experience on 127 cases.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>127</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Early oral squamous cell carcinoma (EOSCC) represents about 90% of the oral cancers especially in older males. The etiology is multifactorial, strongly related to tobacco and alcohol abuse, but also infective agents, Human papillomaviruses (HPV16-18), genetic factors and pre-neoplastic lesions seem to be implicated. There is no consensus in the literature for the treatment of early squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (stages I-II); both an elective neck dissection policy and a watchful-waiting policy have their proponents in the different centers. METHODS: The records of 127 patients with EOSCC of the tongue treated in our Department between 2007 and 2011, with cN0 neck staging, who underwent resection of the primary tumor with or without elective neck dissection, were reviewed. RESULTS: We divided the patients into two groups, in Group 1 the 66 patients who received an elective neck dissection 30 days later from the primary surgery have been included, and in Group 2 the 61 patients undergoing "watchful waiting" observation for the development of nodal metastases have been collected. Statistical calculations were performed using Chi-square and t student test. CONCLUSIONS: A significant difference was found between the two groups as concerns tumor stage and pathologic tumor classification (p  &lt;  0.001). No significant differences were present between the two groups as concerns mean follow up (P  =  0.2), relapse rate (p  =  0.3) and relapse-free survival time (p  =  0.2). In T1 stage tumors with depth of infiltration &lt;= 4  mm, or low grade (G1-G2), the "watchful waiting" strategy for cervical metastases is appropriate, given the low regional recurrence rate (15%) and overall survival of 100%. In case of T2 lesions with depth of infiltration &gt;= 4  mm or high grade (G3) we prefer to perform the elective neck dissection, with 13% of local recurrence and 100% of survival at 6 years.</text>

<text>Prognostic significance of the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio and the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte to tumor-associated macrophage ratio in patients with stage T3N0M0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>

<infon key="type">abstract</infon>

<text>PURPOSE: We assessed the prognostic significance of, and the relationship between, the pretreatment lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) and the TILs/tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) ratio, in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) of pathological stage T3N0M0 (pT3N0M0). METHODS: A total of 220 newly diagnosed ESCC patients of stage pT3N0M0 who had not undergone neoadjuvant therapy were included. Densities of CD8+  TILs, CD4+  TILs, CD45RO+  TILs, and CD68+  TAMs were assessed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray cores from all 220 pT3N0M0 ESCC patients (who underwent radical resection). Hematological biomarkers including lymphocyte and monocyte counts were obtained from routine preoperative blood test data, and the LMR and TILs/TAMs ratios calculated. Cutoff finder for survival prediction was plotted to find out the optimal cutoff point for each parameter. RESULTS: The LMR and TILs/TAMs ratios were interrelated. On univariate analyses of data from the entire cohort, the LMR, CD45RO/CD68 ratio, and CD8/CD68 ratio were significantly associated with both OS and disease-free survival. Only the CD45RO/CD68 ratio was independently prognostic of survival on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic significance of the CD45RO/CD68 ratio was higher than that of the LMR. The CD45RO/CD68 ratio is a useful independent prognostic marker in patients with pT3N0M0 ESCC who have undergone complete resection without neoadjuvant therapy.</text>

<text>Benefits, pitfalls and risks of phytotherapy in clinical practice in otorhinolaryngology.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>89</offset>
<text>OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the benefits, pitfalls and risks of phytotherapy in the clinical practice of otorhinolaryngology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched using the following keywords: phytotherapy, phytomedicine, herbs, otology, rhinology, laryngology, otitis, rhinitis, laryngitis and otorhinolaryngology. Seventy-two articles (18 prospective randomized studies, 4 Cochrane analyses, 4 meta-analysis and 15 reviews of the literature) devoted to clinical studies were analyzed. Articles devoted to in vitro or animal studies, biochemical analyses or case reports (including fewer than 10 patients) and articles dealing with honey, aromatherapy or minerals were excluded. RESULTS: Per os ginkgo biloba has no indications in tinnitus, presbycusis or anosmia following viral rhinitis. Traditional Asian medicine has no proven benefit in sudden deafness or laryngeal papillomatosis. Per os mistletoe extracts associated to conventional treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma does not increase 5-year survival. Extracts of various herbs, notably echinacea, eucalyptus, petasites hybridus, pelargonium sidoides, rosemary, spirulina and thyme, show superiority over placebo for rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis, as does gingko biloba for selected vertigo. There have been encouraging preliminary results for intratumoral injection of mistletoe in head and neck carcinoma and acupoint herbal patching for allergic rhinitis. Herb intake should be screened for in case of certain unexplained symptoms such as epistaxis, headache or dizziness, or signs suggesting allergy. Phytotherapy should be interrupted ahead of surgery and/or chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Scientific proof of the benefit of phytotherapy in otorhinolaryngology remains to be established but, given its widespread use and the reported data, knowledge of this form of treatment needs to be developed.</text>

<text>Necitumumab for the treatment of squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>74</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of all cases and is further subdivided into adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, and large cell carcinoma. Necitumumab (Portrazza   , Eli Lilly and Company) is an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody approved for the first-line treatment of squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine. The safety and efficacy of necitumumab has been evaluated in two-phase III clinical trials, one demonstrating a lack of efficacy in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and another demonstrating improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival in squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer. Necitumumab is associated with adverse events such as infusion reactions, hypomagnesemia, diarrhea, and dermatological toxicities. Although considered a safe and effective treatment option for squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer, the clinical utility of necitumumab may be limited due to the high cost of the drug as well as added toxicity when combined with cisplatin and gemcitabine. Several clinical trials are ongoing in order to further investigate the utilization of necitumumab.</text>

<text>OBJECTIVES: Human papillomavirus (HPV) has emerged as a driving cause of head and neck cancer, but investigations outside the West are limited. A p16 immunohistochemistry is a commonly used biomarker for HPV cancers. We sought to investigate the pathology and rates of HPV head and neck oropharyngeal cancer in Japan via p16 immunohistochemistry at 2 institutions in Japan. METHODS: Fifty-nine oropharyngeal specimens from 2 university hospitals in Japan were examined for morphology and p16 immunohistochemistry. The rate of p16 positivity was then determined, and the 2 groups were compared for differences in age, smoking history, gender, and stage of presentation and mortality. RESULTS: The rate of p16 positivity among the oropharyngeal specimens was 29.5%. There were important differences in the pathology compared to morphology usually seen in the US. The patients with p16+ cancer tended to be younger. There was no significant difference in smoking status. Patients with p16+ cancers trended toward better survival. CONCLUSION: There appears to be a geographical difference in HPV rates of oropharyngeal cancers with persistently lower rates in Asian countries when compared to Western Europe and the US. Conclusions about HPV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in Western countries may not be generalizable across the globe at this time.</text>

<text>Quantifying the Dynamics of Field Cancerization in Tobacco-Related Head and Neck Cancer: A Multiscale Modeling Approach.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>120</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: High rates of local recurrence in tobacco-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are commonly attributed to unresected fields of precancerous tissue. Because they are not easily detectable at the time of surgery without additional biopsies, there is a need for noninvasive methods to predict the extent and dynamics of these fields. Here, we developed a spatial stochastic model of tobacco-related HNSCC at the tissue level and calibrated the model using a Bayesian framework and population-level incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. Probabilistic model analyses were performed to predict the field geometry at time of diagnosis, and model predictions of age-specific recurrence risks were tested against outcome data from SEER. The calibrated models predicted a strong dependence of the local field size on age at diagnosis, with a doubling of the expected field diameter between ages at diagnosis of 50 and 90 years, respectively. Similarly, the probability of harboring multiple, clonally unrelated fields at the time of diagnosis was found to increase substantially with patient age. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized a higher recurrence risk in older than in younger patients when treated by surgery alone; we successfully tested this hypothesis using age-stratified outcome data. Further clinical studies are needed to validate the model predictions in a patient-specific setting. This work highlights the importance of spatial structure in models of epithelial carcinogenesis and suggests that patient age at diagnosis may be a critical predictor of the size and multiplicity of precancerous lesions.

<text>HPV status, cancer stem cell marker expression, hypoxia gene signatures and tumour volume identify good prognosis subgroups in patients with HNSCC after primary radiochemotherapy: A multicentre retrospective study of the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG).</text>

<text>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the tumour volume, HPV status, cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression and hypoxia gene signatures, as potential markers of radiobiological mechanisms of radioresistance, in a contemporary cohort of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who received primary radiochemotherapy (RCTx). MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 158 patients with locally advanced HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx or hypopharynx who were treated at six DKTK partner sites, the impact of tumour volume, HPV DNA, p16 overexpression, p53 expression, CSC marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures on outcome of primary RCTx was retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional control (LRC). RESULTS: Univariate Cox regression revealed a significant impact of tumour volume, p16 overexpression, and SLC3A2 and CD44 protein expression on LRC. The tumour hypoxia classification showed a significant impact only for small tumours. In multivariate analyses an independent correlation of tumour volume, SLC3A2 expression, and the 15-gene hypoxia signature with LRC was identified (CD44 protein n/a because of no event in the CD44-negative group). Logistic modelling showed that inclusion of CD44 protein expression and p16 overexpression significantly improved the performance to predict LRC at 2years compared to the model with tumour volume alone. CONCLUSIONS: Tumour volume, HPV status, CSC marker expression and hypoxia gene signatures are potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced HNSCC, who were treated by primary RCTx. The study also supports that the individual tumour volumes should generally be included in biomarker studies and that panels of biomarkers are superior to individual parameters.</text>

<text>Prognostic significance of venous invasion and maximum standardized uptake value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in surgically resected T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>164</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the risk factors of recurrence in patients with early stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 190 patients with confirmed T1N0M0 ESCC after curative esophagectomy. The following potential prognostic factors for recurrence were investigated: age, sex, pathologic T category, tumor location, differentiation grade, tumor size, venous invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, perineural invasion and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the primary tumor. RESULTS: There were 174 male and 16 female patients with a median age of 66.0 years (range, 42.0-79.0 years). The pathologic status of the surgically resected ESCCs was T1a in 93 patients (48.9%) and T1b in 97 patients (51.1%). The median number of dissected lymph nodes was 35 (range, 10 to 86), and all lymph nodes were negative for tumors. The multivariate analysis showed presence of venous invasion [HR (hazard ratio), 11.433; P  &lt;  0.001) and SUVmax  &gt;=   3.2 (HR, 2.830; P  =  0.011) as independent risk factors for recurrence. The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 25.0% for patients with venous invasion and 78.9% for those without (P  &lt;  0.001). The 5-year RFS was 67.1% for patients with an SUVmax &gt;= 3.2 and 81.5% for those with an SUVmax &lt;3.2 (P  =  0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Venous invasion and high SUVmax could be important prognostic factors coupled with the TNM staging system, in patients with early stage ESCC.</text>

<text>Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier function is negatively linked to Warburg phenotype in vitro and malignant features in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>153</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Aerobic glycolysis is one of the emerging hallmarks of cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the relationship between blocking mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) with MPC blocker UK5099 and the metabolic alteration as well as aggressive features of esophageal squamous carcinoma. It was found that blocking pyruvate transportation into mitochondria attenuated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and triggered aerobic glycolysis, a feature of Warburg effect. In addition, the HIF-1a expression and ROS production were also activated upon UK5099 application. It was further revealed that the UK5099-treated cells became significantly more resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the UK5099-treated tumor cells also exhibited stronger invasive capacity compared to the parental cells. In contrast to esophageal squamous epithelium cells, decreased MPC protein expression was observed in a series of 157 human squamous cell carcinomas, and low/negative MPC1 expression predicted an unfavorable clinical outcome. All these results together revealed the potential connection of altered MPC expression/activity with the Warburg metabolic reprogramming and tumor aggressiveness in cell lines and clinical samples. Collectively, our findings highlighted a therapeutic strategy targeting Warburg reprogramming of human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is the key enzyme in the Warburg effect and plays a central role in cancer cell metabolic reprogramming. Recently, quite a few studies have investigated the correlation between PKM2 expression and prognosis in multiple cancer patients, but results were inconsistent. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to explore the prognostic value of PKM2 expression in patients with solid cancer. Here twenty-seven individual studies from 25 publications with a total of 4796 cases were included to explore the association between PKM2 and overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS)/ progression-free survival (PFS)/ recurrent-free survival (RFS) in subjects with solid cancer. Pooled analysis showed that high levels of PKM2 was significantly associated with a poorer overall survival (HR = 1.73; 95%CI = 1.48-2.03) and DFS/ PFS/ RFS (HR = 1.90; 95%CI = 1.39-2.59) irrespective of cancer types. Different analysis models (univariate or multivariate models), sample-sizes (&lt;= 100 or &gt;100), and methods for data collection (direct extraction or indirect extraction) had no impact on the negative prognostic effect of PKM2 over-expression. Nevertheless, stratified by cancer type, high-expression of PKM2 was associated with an unfavorable OS in breast cancer, esophageal squamous carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and gallbladder cancer; whereas was not correlated with a worse OS in pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer. In conclusion, over-expression of PKM2 is associated with poor prognosis in most solid cancers and it might be a potentially useful biomarker for predicting cancer prognosis in future clinical applications.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Methylation of the WIF-1 gene can lead to the loss of WIF-1 expression which has been observed in numerous types of cancer including NSCLC. However, the association and clinicopathological significance between WIF-1 promoter hypermethylation and NSCLC remains unclear. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of WIF-1 hypermethylation in NSCLC. A systematic literature search was carried out using Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI. The Cochrane software Review manager 5.2 was used. The frequency of WIF-1 hypermethylation was significantly increased in NSCLC compared with normal lung tissue; the pooled OR was 8.67 with 95% CI 1.64-45.88, p = 0.01. The rate of WIF-1 hypermethylation was higher in SCC than in AC, OR was 1.74 with 95% CI 0.97-3.11, p = 0.06. In addition, WIF-1 loss was correlated with low 5-year survival rate. In summary, WIF-1 hypermethylation is a potential biomarker for diagnosis of NSCLC. WIF-1 hypermethylation is predominant in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), suggesting that WIF-1methylation contributes to the development of NSCLC, especially SCC.</text>

<text>Thyroid sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia: a clinicopathologic and molecular analysis of a distinct entity.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>127</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia is a rare thyroid neoplasm of uncertain pathogenesis that resembles salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma. This multi-institutional study characterizes the clinicopathologic and molecular features of this tumor by utilizing next-generation sequencing to assess common mutations and gene fusions involved in thyroid carcinogenesis as well as fluorescence in-situ hybridization for MAML2 translocations typical of salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Nine cases (6 females and 3 males, mean age: 59 years, range 30-77 years) were identified. All cases were comprised of nests and strands of tumor cells with both squamous and mucinous differentiation embedded in a fibrohyaline stroma with an inflammatory infiltrate replete with eosinophils. All cases were p63 positive, thyroglobulin negative and showed variable expression of TTF-1. All nine cases were negative for MAML2 rearrangements. Five cases successfully tested by next-generation sequencing (ThyroSeq v.2 assay) were negative for mutations and translocations commonly involved in thyroid carcinogenesis. NTRK1 showed overexpression but no evidence of translocation. On follow-up, one patient died of persistent disease, whereas one of four remaining patients with available follow-up (mean: 7.3 years, range 4-11 years) demonstrated recurrence at 4 years. Thus, we show that sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia appears molecularly and morphologically distinct from follicular and C-cell-derived thyroid tumors as well as from salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The overall and recurrence-free survival for these patients may be lower than for other well-differentiated thyroid cancers.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 2 December 2016; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.180.</text>

<text>Molecular Pathology of Malignant Transformation of Oral Submucous Fibrosis.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>75</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is prevalent mostly in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Indian subcontinent. Chewing betel nuts and betel leaves, with or without tobacco, has been associated with OSF. Betel quid contents including guvacine, arecoline, guvacoline, arecaidine, and chavibetol are considered to play an important part in the occurrence of OSF. Transformation of OSF to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is variable, but up to 13% conversion of OSF to SCC has been reported. Various genetic and molecular mechanisms impact the malignant transformation of OSF, causing changes in the cell cycle, DNA, keratinocytes, and keratin; tumor-cell proliferation and survival; angiogenesis; fibrosis through epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), and tissue hypoxia. All are reviewed here, including potential biomarkers for malignant transformation of OSF. These interactions are not fully understood, but a critical mass of knowledge is building up to ultimately allow the understanding of all mechanisms involved.</text>

<text>Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Current Treatment Strategies and Nanotechnology-Based Approaches for Prevention and Therapy.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>122</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of oral cancer; it involves damage to oral epithelial cells due to accumulation of multiple genetic mutations in the cells. OSCC remains major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with head and neck cancers. Tobacco, smoking, alcohol consumption alone or with chewing tobacco, and betel quid are potential carcinogens contributing to the high occurrence of OSCC. Current treatment modalities for OSCC like chemoradiotherapy, surgery, EGFR inhibitors and COX-2 inhibitors, and photodynamic therapy have led to the major problems related to non-specific cell death. Nanoengineered systems offer solutions to these problems that not only minimize the major drawbacks of nonspecific cell death but also maximize the efficacy of the cancer therapeutic agents. Various efficacious nanotechnology-based carrier systems are being widely investigated for their potential in OSCC treatment: polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, nanoemulsions and layered nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles and nanolipid carriers, cyclodextrin complexes, hydrogels, metallic nanoparticles, nanocarbon tubes, and receptor mediated drug delivery systems. We highlight the etiology, line of the treatment and chemopreventive measures related to OSCC. We focus on data available in the research carried out worldwide in past 15 years related to the management of OSCC.</text>

<offset>31</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: A substantial increase in the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has been observed in Western countries during the past 30  years, which may be related to the parallel rise of the obesity prevalence. On the other hand, incidence rates of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, the other major histological type of oesophageal cancer, have remained relatively stable. Epidemiological research of the past decades has identified obesity as risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Studies investigating general obesity as assessed by body mass index (BMI) provide evidence for a strong positive association with oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Studies investigating abdominal obesity in relation to oesophageal adenocarcinoma observed also positive associations, which may be independent of general obesity. Some studies indicate that early life obesity is also associated with higher risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, but it is as to date unclear whether these associations are independent of adult obesity. Part of the positive association between obesity and oesophageal adenocarcinoma may be explained through obesity-related mechanical promotion of gastroesophageal reflux disease, which is one of the main risk factors for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Other lines of evidence point to an independent role of metabolic pathways modulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell growth such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, adipokines and insulin resistance, the role of which in oesophageal carcinogenesis is, however, as to date insufficiently understood. Studies investigating obesity in relation to squamous cell carcinoma observed inverse relationships, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: TIMELESS is a highly conserved protein required for the maintenance of normal mammalian circadian oscillations and for controlling cellular metabolism and proliferation. Recently, TIMELESS was implicated in the tumorigenesis of certain cancers. However, little is known on TIMELESS protein expression and its potential as a prognostic factor in cervical cancer. Here, we investigate TIMELESS expression pattern and its clinicopathological significance in early-stage cervical carcinoma. TIMELESS mRNA and protein expression was evaluated by real-time PCR and western blot analysis in cervical cancer cell lines, a normal cervical cell line, as well as in six pairs of surgically removed cervical cancer and adjacent normal cervical tissues. A total of 189 paraffin-embedded cervical carcinoma specimens were detected and diagnosed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the clinical significance of TIMELESS expression was further analyzed. Aberrant TIMELESS mRNA and protein expression were demonstrated in cervical cancer cell lines compared with the normal cervical cell line. TIMELESS mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased in cervical cancer specimens compared with adjacent non-cancerous cervical specimens. TIMELESS protein expression was significantly associated with the age (P=0.011), clinical stage (P&lt;0.001), pelvic lymph node metastasis (P&lt;0.001), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (P=0.003), tumor recurrence (P=0.015), vital status (P&lt;0.001), tumor differentiation grade (P&lt;0.001), property of the surgical margin (P=0.036) and lymphovascular space involvement (P=0.001). Patients with increased TIMELESS protein expression showed strong tendencies to receive postoperative radiotherapy (P=0.002). Upregulation of TIMELESS correlated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analyses showed that TIMELESS can be regarded as an independent predictive biomarker for poor clinical outcome for early-stage cervical carcinoma. Our results show that TIMELESS overexpression correlates with pelvic lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular space involvement, as well as unfavorable OS and DFS in human cervical cancer. Therefore, TIMELESS expression may be a potential prognostic biomarker for cervical cancer patients.</text>

<text>Primary Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Pancreas as a Cause of Biliary Obstruction.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>82</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas (SCCP) is a rare neoplasm, given a lack of naturally occurring squamous cells within the pancreas, accounting for only 0.2% of all pancreatic cancers. The etiology is unknown. Symptomatology is non-specific and similar to other pancreatic neoplasms. No non-invasive testing can adequately rule in SCCP, and workup should proceed similarly to any pancreatic mass. Tissue sampling is required for diagnosis and guidance of further management, most commonly by endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspirate. SCCP is more aggressive than adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with a median survival of three and ten months for those treated with palliative and surgical intent, respectively. The optimal treatment regimen remains unknown, though the uses of radiation therapy, platinum-based regimens, gemcitabine, and 5-FU have all been reported with favorable results. We present a case of primary SCCP in an 81-year-old female who presented with jaundice.</text>

<text>Invasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Scalp and Calvarium: A Multidisciplinary Approach.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>90</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Objective: The correlation between immunosuppression-associated skin cancer and lymphoma has been well established. This includes squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. When a lesion requires excision, reconstruction can be challenging based on the depth and size of the tumor. We present a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp that extended through the calvarium to the dura mater. His tumors were badly neglected for a long period of time and presented at an advanced stage. Methods: This type of reconstruction was performed utilizing a multidisciplinary approach. Our patient required calvarial reconstruction with titanium mesh, dural reconstruction, latissimus dorsi free flap, and an overlying skin graft. Results: The patient had appropriate resection of his tumor while maintaining flap viability. Postoperatively, he presented with excellent soft-tissue thickness and aesthetic result. Conclusion: We believe that this type of reconstruction was best, considering our patient had a significant scalp and calvarial defect at presentation. Using a latissimus dorsi free flap bestows a robust blood supply to help decrease infections and improve healing and circulation, especially in light of the need of further radiation therapy.</text>

<text>Prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients with level IV/V metastasis: An observational study.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>102</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to retrospectively describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with level IV/V metastases, and to evaluate the multivariate relationships among potential risk factors for metastasis and prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 291 patients (178 men and 113 women; mean age, 65.9      13.5 years). Clinicopathological data, time of development of level IV/V metastases, and clinical course were investigated. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (7.9%) developed level IV/V metastases. The 3-year overall survival rates when level IV/V metastasis first developed were 27.3% upon initial treatment, 57.1% when metachronous neck metastasis developed, and 40.0% when the tumor recurred. Oral tongue tumor subsite, high N staging, neck dissection when metachronous neck metastasis developed, as well as recurrence were independent risk factors for level IV/V metastasis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate here the multivariate relationships among the risk factors indicated above for level IV/V metastasis and their prognostic significance for patients with OSCC. Oral tongue tumors, high N staging, and neck dissection upon the occurrence of metachronous neck metastasis or recurrence were risk factors for level IV/V metastasis and positive extracapsular spread, presence of multiple lymph metastases, and moderate or poor differentiation were poor prognostic factors.</text>

<text>Skin surface brachytherapy: A survey of contemporary practice patterns.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>71</offset>
<text>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to define current patterns of care among radiation oncologists who use skin surface brachytherapy for the treatment of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in academic and community settings. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 30-question electronic survey was administered to clinician members of the American Brachytherapy Society. The respondents were asked to provide details regarding their clinical practice and their approach to skin surface brachytherapy. RESULTS: A total of 16 surveys were returned. Among the respondents, aggregate experience varied from 8 to 1800 cases. Most preferred brachytherapy over external beam radiation because of shorter treatment course, conformality of treatment for irregular or curved targets, and shallow dose deposition. Of the total, 60% of respondents routinely estimated lesion depth via ultrasound before initiating treatment. Treatment margin on gross disease varied widely (range, 3-15  mm; median, 5  mm). Hypofractionation was the preferred dose schedule. Prescribed doses ranged from 30  Gy in five fractions to 64  Gy in 32 fractions (EQD2, 40  Gy-65  Gy). There was a tendency to increase the number of fractions for larger targets, although some used the same fractionation regardless of anatomic location or lesion size. There was no consensus on dosimetric constraints, and some respondents reported cases of severe toxicity, particularly when treating the pretibial skin. CONCLUSIONS: This pattern of care study suggests that skin brachytherapy can be a convenient and safe tool for treatment of BCC and cSCC. Prospective trials and the development of expert consensus guidelines would be beneficial for optimizing skin surface brachytherapy and reducing practice variation.</text>

<text>Squamous cell carcinoma presenting with trigeminal anesthesia: An uncommon presentation of head _ neck cancer with unknown primary.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>131</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of facial anesthesia is vast. This may be secondary to trauma, neoplasm, both intracranial and extracranial, infection, and neurologic disease. When evaluating a patient with isolated facial anesthesia, the head and neck surgeon often thinks of adenoid cystic carcinoma, which has a propensity for perineural invasion and spread. When one thinks of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with or without unknown primary, the typical presentation involves dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, hoarseness, or more commonly, a neck mass. Squamous cell carcinoma presenting as facial anesthesia and perineural spread, with no primary site is quite rare. METHODS: Case presentations and review of the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Trigeminal anesthesia is an uncommon presentation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with unknown primary. We present two interesting cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the trigeminal nerve, with no primary site identified. We will also review the literature of head and neck malignancies with perineural spread and the management techniques for the two different cases presented.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a high morbidity in China and its treatment depends greatly on adjuvant chemotherapy. However, DNA damage repair in cancer cells severely affects the outcome of treatment. This study investigated the potential mechanism regarding mediator of DNA-damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCMs) during DNA damage in ESCC. Recombinant vectors of MDC1 and MCMs with tags were constructed and transfected into human ESCC cell line TE-1. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were performed to screen the MCMs interacting with MDC1, and direct interaction was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay in vitro. MCM2 and MCM6 were knocked down by shRNAs, after which chromatin fraction and foci forming of MDC1 upon bleomycin-induced DNA damage were examined. The results showed that MCM2/3/5/6 were immunoprecipitated by antibodies against the tag of MDC1 in TE-1 nuclei, and the GST pull-down assay indicated the direct interaction. Knockdown of MCM2 or MCM6 reduced the chromatin fraction of MDC1 according to Western blot results. Moreover, knockdown of MCM2 or MCM6 could significantly inhibit foci forming of MDC1 in TE-1 nuclei in response to bleomycin-induced DNA damage (p &lt; 0.001). This study indicates the direct interaction between MDC1 and MCMs in TE-1 nuclei. Downregulation of MCMs can inhibit chromatin fraction and foci forming of MDC1 in TE-1 cells upon DNA damage, which suggests MCMs and MDC1 as potential targets to improve the outcome of chemotherapy in ESCC.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) requires reassessment. We have conducted a trial aiming at the comparison between DCF and ACF concerning perioperative adverse events. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either DCF [docetaxel 70 mg/m2, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on day 1, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 700 mg/m2 for 5 days] every 3 weeks or ACF (adriamycin 35 mg/m2, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on day 1, and 5-FU 700 mg/m2 for 7 days) every 4 weeks. Each group consisted of 81 patients. Two cycles of preoperative chemotherapy were planned, after which patients underwent subtotal esophagectomy via a right thoracotomy with lymphadenectomy. Chemotherapy- and surgery-related adverse effects were assessed. RESULTS: Grade 3-4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia occurred in 90 and 39% of patients, respectively, in the DCF group compared with 69 and 17% of patients, respectively, in the ACF group (p &lt; 0.01). Perioperative complications did not differ significantly between the groups. The overall response rates of DCF and ACF were 61 and 40%, respectively, while the histopathological complete responses were 15 and 3%, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The DCF and ACF regimens were found to be equally feasible in patients with resectable advanced ESCC; however, DCF delivered an antitumor effect and therefore potentially improved the long-term outcomes.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: Aging is associated with a rising incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), an aggressive skin cancer with the potential for local invasion and metastasis. Acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in dermal fibroblasts has been postulated to promote skin cancer progression in elderly individuals. The underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unexplored. We show that Chemerin, a previously unreported SASP factor released from senescent human dermal fibroblasts, promotes cSCC cell migration, a key feature driving tumor progression. Whereas the Chemerin abundance is downregulated in malignant cSCC cells, increased Chemerin transcripts and protein concentrations are detected in replicative senescent fibroblasts in vitro and in the fibroblast of skin sections from old donors, indicating that a Chemerin gradient is built up in the dermis of elderly. Using Transwell   migration assays, we show that Chemerin enhances the chemotaxis of different cSCC cell lines. Notably, the Chemerin receptor CCRL2 is remarkably upregulated in cSCC cell lines and human patient biopsies. Silencing Chemerin in senescent fibroblasts or the CCRL2 and GPR1 receptors in the SCL-1 cSCC cell line abrogates the Chemerin-mediated chemotaxis. Chemerin triggers the MAPK cascade via JNK and ERK1 activation, whereby the inhibition impairs the SASP- or Chemerin-mediated cSCC cell migration.Taken together, we uncover a key role for Chemerin, as a major factor in the secretome of senescent fibroblasts, promoting cSCC cell migration and possibly progression, relaying its signals through CCRL2 and GPR1 receptors with subsequent MAPK activation. These findings might have implications for targeted therapeutic interventions in elderly patients.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: S100A7 is expressed in many squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Our previous study revealed that S100A7 was dramatically induced in several SCC cells and activation of the Hippo pathway significantly promoted S100A7 in epidermoid carcinoma cells. However, whether the Hippo pathway regulates S100A7 expression in SCCs remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover that S100A7 induction by the Hippo-YAP pathway displays different characteristic in cervical and glossopharyngeal SCC. In well differentiated HCC94 cervical cells and FaDu pharyngeal cells, S100A7 is easily induced by both suspension and dense culture, which is accompanied by an increase in YAP phosphorylation and a decrease in nuclear YAP. Strikingly, these correlations of S100A7 and YAP reverse after recovery of cell attachment or relief from dense culture. Further examination finds that S100A7 induction is significantly repressed by nuclear YAP, which is validated by activation or inhibition of the Hippo pathway via loss- and/or gain-of- LATS1 and MST1 function. Subsequently, we prove that TEAD1 is required for YAP transcriptional repression of S100A7. However, S100A7 is hardly induced in poorly differentiated SiHa cervical cells and NCI-H226 pulmonary cells even in suspension or activation of the Hippo pathway. More importantly, cervical and lingual SCC tissues array analyses show that S100A7 expression displays the positive correlation with pYAP-S127 and the negative correlation with nuclear YAP in the majority of well differentiated but not in poorly differentiated tissues. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the different induction of S100A7 toward activation of the Hippo pathway mainly depends on the degree of cell differentiation in cervical and glossopharyngeal SCC.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: INTRODUCTION A specific receptor for interleukin 8, known as C-X-C chemokine type  -2 receptor (CXCR  -2), is one of the 7  -transmembrane G  -protein  -coupled receptors. Its involvement in the development of numerous malignancies, including esophageal cancer (EC), has been suggested. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of serum CXCR  -2 level measurement in patients with EC, in comparison with C  -reactive protein (CRP) levels and classic tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC  -Ag).   PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included 72 individuals: 42 patients with EC and 30 healthy volunteers. Serum CXCR  -2 concentrations were measured by an immunoenzymatic assay. The levels of classic tumor markers were measured using the chemiluminescent method, and CRP levels were measured using the immunoturbidimetric method. RESULTS Serum CXCR  -2 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with EC than in the control group, similarly to CEA and CRP levels. Moreover, CXCR  -2 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with poorly differentiated EC (G3) compared with those with G2 tumors. The diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, as well as the negative predictive value of the serum CXCR  -2 assay were higher than those observed for classic tumor markers and slightly lower than those observed for CRP levels. The highest diagnostic sensitivity was found for the combined analysis of CXCR  -2 and CRP. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest the role of CXCR  -2 in the development of EC. Thus, further research is needed to clarify the significance of chemokines and their receptors as potential tumor markers of EC.</text>

<text>BACKGROUND: African Americans with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have a lower survival rate than whites. This study investigated the functional importance of ancestry-informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HNSCC and also examined the effect of functionally important genetic elements on racial disparities in HNSCC survival. METHODS: Ancestry-informative SNPs, RNA sequencing, methylation, and copy number variation data for 316 oral cavity and laryngeal cancer patients were analyzed across 178 DNA repair genes. The results of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses were also replicated with a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data set. The effects of eQTLs on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated. RESULTS: Five ancestry-related SNPs were identified as cis-eQTLs in the DNA polymerase b (POLB) gene (false discovery rate [FDR]   &lt;   0.01). The homozygous/heterozygous genotypes containing the African allele showed higher POLB expression than the homozygous white allele genotype (P   &lt;   .001). A replication study using a GEO data set validated all 5 eQTLs and also showed a statistically significant difference in POLB expression based on genetic ancestry (P   =   .002). An association was observed between these eQTLs and OS (P   &lt;   .037; FDR   &lt;   0.0363) as well as DFS (P   =   .018 to .0629; FDR   &lt;   0.079) for oral cavity and laryngeal cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Genotypes containing the African allele were associated with poor OS/DFS in comparison with homozygous genotypes harboring the white allele. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses show that ancestry-related alleles could act as eQTLs in HNSCC and support the association of ancestry-related genetic factors with survival disparities in patients diagnosed with oral cavity and laryngeal cancer.

<text>Immunotherapy of head and neck cancer: Emerging clinical trials from a National Cancer Institute Head and Neck Cancer Steering Committee Planning Meeting.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>154</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Recent advances have permitted successful therapeutic targeting of the immune system in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). These new immunotherapeutic targets and agents are being rapidly adopted by the oncologic community and hold considerable promise. The National Cancer Institute sponsored a Clinical Trials Planning Meeting to address the issue of how to further investigate the use of immunotherapy in patients with HNSCC. The goals of the meeting were to consider phase 2 or 3 trial designs primarily in 3 different patient populations: those with previously untreated, human papillomavirus-initiated oropharyngeal cancers; those with previously untreated, human papillomavirus-negative HNSCC; and those with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. In addition, a separate committee was formed to develop integrative biomarkers for the clinical trials. The meeting started with an overview of key immune components and principles related to HNSCC, including immunosurveillance and immune escape. Four clinical trial concepts were developed at the meeting integrating different immunotherapies with existing standards of care. These designs were presented for implementation by the head and neck committees of the National Cancer Institute-funded National Clinical Trials Network. This article summarizes the proceedings of this Clinical Trials Planning Meeting, the purpose of which was to facilitate the rigorous development and design of randomized phase 2 and 3 immunotherapeutic trials in patients with HNSCC. Although reviews usually are published immediately after the meeting is held, this report is unique because there are now tangible clinical trial designs that have been funded and put into practice and the studies are being activated to accrual.

<text>Differential mutation frequencies in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas versus primary tumors.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>105</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Exome and targeted sequencing studies have identified potential driver mutations for a variety of tumor types. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is one of the most highly mutated cancers but typically is associated with low rates of metastasis and high survival rates. Nevertheless, metastatic cSCC is a significant health threat; up to 8800 individuals die each year of this disease. METHODS: Because it is difficult to predict which cSCCs are more likely to metastasize, and because to the best of the authors' knowledge there are no targeted therapies specifically designated for patients with metastatic cSCC, exome and/or targeted sequencing of 18 metastatic and 10 primary cSCCs was performed to identify mutations that were more frequent in metastatic tumors and might be targeted for therapeutic benefit. The authors compared their results with published sequencing results of an additional 223 primary tumors and 68 metastatic cSCCs. RESULTS: The authors identified genes demonstrating higher mutation frequencies in metastatic cSCC compared with primary tumors, including the chromatin remodeling gene lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and the classic skin tumor suppressor tumor protein p53 (TP53), which was found to be mutated in 54% of primary tumors compared with 85% of metastatic tumors (P&lt;.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These studies appear to uncover potential pathways that are important in metastatic cSCC and that broaden understanding of the biology contributing to aggressive tumor behavior. These results may lead to new therapeutic strategies. Cancer 2016.    2016 American Cancer Society.</text>

<text>Decreasing loco-regional recurrence for oral cavity cancer with total Mohs margins technique.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>93</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: The conventional technique for cancer resection margin analysis studies only 0.1% of the surgical margins. Complete frozen section margins - also known as Mohs margins - allows for analysis of 100% of the  surgical margins. METHODS: The objective of our study is to compare oral cavity cancer loco-regional recurrence rates when treated by total frozen sections technique (Total Mohs margins) versus conventional margins. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort chart review. Loco-regional oral cancer recurrence rates were compared between patients treated with total Mohs margins (2007-2013) and patients treated with conventional margins techniques (2002-2007). RESULTS: After applying inclusion criteria, a total of 60 patients treated by total Mohs margins and 57 patients with conventional margins were identified. Patients had similar baseline cancer stages, pathological types, past head and neck cancers and comorbidities (all p   &gt;   0.05). One-year recurrence rate was lower (10.0% vs 21.1%, p   =   0.019) in favor of Mohs total margins and stayed significantly lower at 5  years of follow-up. When adjusted for T grade with N0 disease, Mohs technique was still beneficial in loco-regional recurrence for Tis-T4N0 up to 2  years (10.5% vs 25.7%, z-score 1.849, p   =   0.032). The Number Needed to Treat at 2  years of follow-up for this subgroup of patients (Tis-T4N0) is 6.6. Margins had to be retaken more often intra-operatively in Mohs technique (68.3% vs 12.3%, p   &lt;   0.0001), mainly for positive deep margins (48.6% of all margins, p   =   0.028). Duration of surgery was not increased with Mohs vs conventional technique (380  min vs 475  min respectively, p   =   0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Mohs total margins may result in a significant reduction in cancer recurrence rate at 5  years compare to conventional surgery. Moreover, duration of surgery was not increased when using Mohs technique when judiciously performed.</text>

<text>Is radical surgery of an inverted papilloma of the maxillary sinus obsolete? a case report.</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>91</offset>
<text>BACKGROUND: Sinonasal inverted papilloma is a locally aggressive tumor arising from the Schneiderian membrane which lines the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Aggressive surgical approaches, such as lateral rhinotomy, were used until recently for complete removal of the inverted papilloma. Currently, endoscopic resection is the gold standard in the treatment of inverted papilloma. However, there are situations that justify an open approach. For example there are studies that report a higher postoperative recurrence rate after endonasal endoscopic resection, particularly in the treatment of recurrent diseases. While endoscopic resection performed by an experienced surgeon is definitely a minimally invasive therapy, an open approach is not necessarily associated with functional and aesthetic disadvantages. This case report describes the treatment of inverted papilloma by an open approach. This has been described before but the new gold standard of endoscopic resection has to be taken into account before any treatment decision is made nowadays. CASE PRESENTATION: Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck area was indicated in a 72-year-old white German man who presented with suspected squamous cell carcinoma of his lower lip. Magnetic resonance imaging additionally revealed a 3*2 cm(2) polycyclic arranged mucosal thickening with cystic and solid contrast affine shares at the antral laterocaudal area of his right maxillary sinus, extending from his right lateral nasal wall to his maxillary sinus floor. He received antral polypectomy with medial maxillectomy via a unilateral LeFort I osteotomy approach. His pterygoid plate was preserved. A histological examination demonstrated a tumor composed of hyperplastic squamous epithelium protruding into the stroma (surface epithelial cells grew downward into the underlying supportive tissue), thus producing a grossly convoluted cerebriform appearance. Two weeks later, the patient regained a well-formed maxilla without any restrictions. He has remained disease-free for 25 months following the surgery and surveillance was continued in our tumor clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic resection of an inverted papilloma continues to be the gold standard. However, some cases require a radical approach. This does not necessarily increase patient morbidity.</text>

<text>What is the impact of biologic therapies on common co-morbidities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis?</text>
</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>104</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Biologic therapies have revolutionised disease control in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Theoretically, they have the potential to influence co-morbid disease associated with RA through better control of systemic inflammation. Conversely, co-morbidity may occur as an adverse effect of the drugs. The latest evidence from observational data shows an increased risk of infection in the first 6  months of treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) therapies and potentially other biologic therapies. Rates of infection after the first 6  months decrease and become comparable to patients with RA treated with conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). TNFi also appear to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients, in particular ischaemic heart disease. TNFi treatment may be associated with a small increase in the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; in terms of other cancers, rates appears to be no different to those seen in patients treated with csDMARDs. There is a paucity of data on the impact of other biologic therapies and the effect of all biologic therapies on other common co-morbidities.</text>

</passage>
<passage>
<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
<offset>134</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: Erythroplasia of Queyrat (EQ) is a rare disease involving the mucosal and transitional surfaces of the penis. Effective treatment is necessary to minimize progression to squamous cell carcinoma. The standard therapy for EQ, partial or radical penectomy, is invasive; photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be an effective, non-surgical tissue-sparing option. We report the case of a 67-year-old patient with long-standing EQ who was successfully treated with methyl aminolevulinate-PDT (MAL-PDT). A complete clinical response, confirmed by incisional biopsy, was achieved after five sessions of every-other-week treatment. The patient experienced moderate edema, erythema and pain within 5-7 days after the treatment, without urination problems. Our experience and a review of the published literature suggest that MAL-PDT may represent a valuable treatment option for selected cases of histopathologically-confirmed EQ.</text>

<text>Recommendations for pathologic staging (pTNM) of cancer of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction for the 8th edition AJCC/UICC staging manuals.</text>
</passage>

<offset>148</offset>
<text>UNASSIGNED: We report analytic and consensus processes that produced recommendations for pathologic stage groups (pTNM) of esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer for the AJCC/UICC cancer staging manuals, 8th edition. The Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration provided data for 22,654 patients with epithelial esophageal cancers; 13,300 without preoperative therapy had pathologic assessment after esophagectomy or endoscopic treatment. Risk-adjusted survival for each patient was developed using random survival forest analysis to identify data-driven pathologic stage groups wherein survival decreased monotonically with increasing group, was distinctive between groups, and homogeneous within groups. The AJCC Upper GI Task Force, by smoothing, simplifying, expanding, and assessing clinical applicability, produced consensus pathologic stage groups. For pT1-3N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and pT1-2N0M0 adenocarcinoma, pT was inadequate for grouping; subcategorizing pT1 and adding histologic grade enhanced staging; cancer location improved SCC staging. Consensus eliminated location for pT2N0M0 and pT3N0M0G1 SCC groups, and despite similar survival, restricted stage 0 to pTis, excluding pT1aN0M0G1. Metastases markedly reduced survival; pT, pN, and pM sufficiently grouped advanced cancers. Stage IIA and IIB had different compositions for SCC and adenocarcinoma, but similar survival. Consensus stage IV subgrouping acknowledged pT4N+ and pN3 cancers had poor survival, similar to pM1. Anatomic pathologic stage grouping, based on pTNM only, produced identical consensus stage groups for SCC and adenocarcinoma at the cost of homogeneity in early groups. Pathologic staging can neither direct pre-treatment decisions nor aid in prognostication for treatment other than esophagectomy or endoscopic therapy. However, it provides a clean, single therapy reference point for esophageal cancer.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: We report analytic and consensus processes that produced recommendations for clinical stage groups (cTNM) of esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer for the AJCC/UICC cancer staging manuals, 8th edition. The Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration (WECC) provided data on 22,123 clinically staged patients with epithelial esophageal cancers. Risk-adjusted survival for each patient was developed using random survival forest analysis from which (1) data-driven clinical stage groups were identified wherein survival decreased monotonically and was distinctive between and homogeneous within groups and (2) data-driven anatomic clinical stage groups based only on cTNM. The AJCC Upper GI Task Force, by smoothing, simplifying, expanding, and assessing clinical applicability, produced (3) consensus clinical stage groups. Compared with pTNM, cTNM survival was "pinched," with poorer survival for early cStage groups and better survival for advanced ones. Histologic grade was distinctive for data-driven grouping of cT2N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cT1-2N0M0 adenocarcinoma, but consensus removed it. Grouping was different by histopathologic cell type. For SCC, cN0-1 was distinctive for cT3 but not cT1-2, and consensus removed cT4 subclassification and added subgroups 0, IVA, and IVB. For adenocarcinoma, N0-1 was distinctive for cT1-2 but not cT3-4a, cStage II subgrouping was necessary (T1N1M0 [IIA] and T2N0M0 [IIB]), advanced cancers cT3-4aN0-1M0 plus cT2N1M0 comprised cStage III, and consensus added subgroups 0, IVA, and IVB. Treatment decisions require accurate cStage, which differs from pStage. Understaging and overstaging are problematic, and additional factors, such as grade, may facilitate treatment decisions and prognostication until clinical staging techniques are uniformly applied and improved.</text>

<text>Recommendations for neoadjuvant pathologic staging (ypTNM) of cancer of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction for the 8th edition AJCC/UICC staging manuals.</text>

<text>UNASSIGNED: We report analytic and consensus processes that produced recommendations for neoadjuvant pathologic stage groups (ypTNM) of esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer for the AJCC/UICC cancer staging manuals, 8th edition. The Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration provided data for 22,654 patients with epithelial esophageal cancers; 7,773 had pathologic assessment after neoadjuvant therapy. Risk-adjusted survival for each patient was developed. Random forest analysis identified data-driven neoadjuvant pathologic stage groups wherein survival decreased monotonically with increasing group, was distinctive between groups, and homogeneous within groups. An additional analysis produced data-driven anatomic neoadjuvant pathologic stage groups based only on ypT, ypN, and ypM categories. The AJCC Upper GI Task Force, by smoothing, simplifying, expanding, and assessing clinical applicability, produced consensus neoadjuvant pathologic stage groups. Grade and location were much less discriminating for stage grouping ypTNM than pTNM. Data-driven stage grouping without grade and location produced nearly identical groups for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. However, ypTNM groups and their associated survival differed from pTNM. The need for consensus process was minimal. The consensus groups, identical for both cell types were as follows: ypStage I comprised ypT0-2N0M0; ypStage II ypT3N0M0; ypStage IIIA ypT0-2N1M0; ypStage IIIB ypT3N1M0, ypT0-3N2, and ypT4aN0M0; ypStage IVA ypT4aN1-2, ypT4bN0-2, and ypTanyN3M0; and ypStage IVB ypTanyNanyM1. Absence of equivalent pathologic (pTNM) categories for the peculiar neoadjuvant pathologic categories ypTisN0-3M0 and ypT0N0-3M0, dissimilar stage group compositions, and markedly different early- and intermediate-stage survival necessitated a unified, unique set of stage grouping for patients of either cell type who receive neoadjuvant therapy.</text>
